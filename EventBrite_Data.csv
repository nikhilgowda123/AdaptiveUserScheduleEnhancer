What explains the popularity of some research topics over others? Where do management theories come from and why does this matter? How do we decide which ideas attain the status of theory? In this lecture I examine an alluring source of inspiration for theory development in management and strategy research: management fashions. 
Management fashions are simplistic recipes for success accompanied by catchy phrases but scant empirical evidence.  They are created, popularized and disseminated by some of the most powerful idea merchants in the contemporary global economy: management consultants. They have also proven to be highly attractive to management researchers, who have played an important role in cementing their reach, influence and respectability. 
In line with existing inquiry into management fashions, I take an institutional approach to examine how consulting-derived concepts are established and legitimized in the management field. In order to illustrate this process, I select an influential fashion in international strategy – the ‘born global’ firm – and examine its consulting origins and its impact on academic research. By means of an in-depth analysis of key texts, I follow the fashion lifecycle of the ‘born global’ concept, from creation to import, institutionalization and eventual mutation. In doing so, I address how it was that the concept was able to gain legitimacy as a set of theoretical claims, despite the lack of strong empirical foundations or robust examination. 
I conclude with the broader implications for management research and the societal role of universities.  Specifically, I outline how as a scholarly community, we might engage more productively and critically with the influence of management consultants. Now that management scholars are being urged to make our research more ‘relevant’, I argue for the timeliness of examining and rethinking the consulting-research nexus. In a neo-liberal era in which multinational consulting firms have accumulated vast power and influence with very little oversight, I invite a discussion about how management researchers may reassert their identities as independent voices.

People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will:Appear (and feel!) more confident when you present. Speak in a natural, conversational way so that you feel more relaxed.Express your natural creativity and personality quirks so that you feel genuine and authentic.Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Build trust and rapport fastHold people’s attention when they have a million online distractions  Can communicate abstract ideasThirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will:  View you as their #1 expertImplement more of your ideasBuy more of your stuffAre you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home.FAQsIs this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location?Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them. Where can I access the masterclass?You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link within 24hr of the masterclass beginning. In the event that David is not available on the 25th, you will be sent a link to a recording of a previous session.The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis? No. The same series is repeated every month. You only need to attend one event.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Classes', 'Dublin Business Classes']",Free

The lecture will run from 15:30 to 16:30.Location: Fórsa office, Nerney's Court, Rotunda, Dublin 1, D01 R2C5Details of seminar:Michael Taft, Research Officer with SIPTU will present on 'Taking Charge of the Future:  How trade unionists can lead the economic debate'.  He will discuss an Irish Rehn-Meidner model.  Subsequently, a discussion will be open to the floor where the chairperson will present questions to the speaker.Abstract:  Ireland does not have a long-term economic framework – just policies that have lasted a long time.  As we enter into a period of uncertainty and overlapping crises (a ‘polycrisis’) we need a new, progressive and long-term framework to meet these challenges.  And the trade union movement should be the driving agent.We can look to the traditional Swedish model for inspiration.  Contrary to the popular view, the Swedish model was not based on high-tax, high-spend policies.  It was grounded in an economic framework (the Rehn-Meidner model) proposed by the Swedish trade union movement in the early 1950s to meet the challenges of full employment, price stability, income and social equality, and productivity.  The Irish trade union movement should propose its own ‘R-M model’ to meet the challenges of the future.  This is not a compilation of short-term policies to address the latest government failing, but rather a long-term restructuring and democratisation of the productive base of the Irish economy upon which fiscal adequacy and living standards are dependent. This will challenge the current orthodoxy and even many traditional trade union analyses.  In this way Irish trade unionists can ensure that the producers of goods and services (aka the working class) are privileged.Biography of the presenter:  Michael Taft is a Research Officer with SIPTU and author of Notes on the Front, a political economy blog.   He is also a member of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, and the Low Pay Commission.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Seminars', 'Dublin Business Seminars']",

Most jobs today are ""knowledge work"", and you the boss? a big part of your job as the boss, is to teach, is to coach. And a big part of what you have to teach, is wisdom, insights, human nature, understanding of business.Good economy, bad economy, bad employees are dime a dozen. Good employees? Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees.And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.In this On Demand Webinar, we will address real challenges leaders face in the real world, but most training seminars can not and will not address.

I tell them: ""What sort of a Millennial are you? There is nothing Millennial about you! You are giving the rest of them Millennials a bad name:-) You know what, as far as being a Millennial is concerned, you are FIRED!"" They giggle and tell me: ""Thanks, that's the best compliment I've ever got.""Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials...On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12?I am sorry:You hired the wrong person:-)You did not set the right ""frame"" for the relationship between you and your employees - you allowed your employees to take control of the narrative.What are the 4 different types of Millennials?What are the 2 criteria you should use to evaluate millennials?What are the 4 different types of Millennials?For your current employees who are millennials:Which ones should be promoted?Which ones should be coached?Which ones should be ""utilized""?Which ones should be fired?If you want to solve this challenge:You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary!And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right?You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-)The Emperor Has No Clothes On!Millennials have been told a pack of lies, and they are suffering from the spell.You the employer, sadly, have not been told the truth either.Everyone in America is beating around the bush, refusing to come out and say it: ""The Emperor is butt naked!!!""How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge?In this 1 hour on-demand webinar, you will learn the truth the whole truth and nothing but the naked inconvenient truth:1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.)2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.)3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.)4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-) 5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?)6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone.7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them;8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them;9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?In this 1 hour on-demand webinar, you will also learn: What sort of Millennials you should hire from this point on:Why you need to attract only the right candidates, and repel the wrong candidates from even applying.How to attract the right Millennials to come apply for employment with you.How to repel the wrong Millennials from applying employment with you.How to outsmart the candidates, so you filter in the right candidates, and filter out the wrong candidates.Why using conventional job interview questions will result in you hiring a bunch of professional liars:-( And have you been using these interview questions, to your own detriment? (Hint: if you have troublemakers on your team? you know you've been scammed! Fool me once? Fool me twice?)What sort of job interview questions will help you figuring out who is telling the truth?You will learn 1 more important concept in this 1 hour on-demand webinar: How to Establish a Whole New Narrative with Your Employees:And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite:Your employees understand: true confidence, real self esteem, can only be earned, by overcoming challenges, by practicing fear busting and by expanding their own comfort zones.Your employees understand that ""growth"" doesn't mean ""I've been given more goodies for free"". They understand ""growth"" means they've busted more fears and expanded their comfort zones.You employees cherish the challenges you give them, because they understand overcoming challenges is the only way to grow.Your employees are grateful for their growth, both professionally and personally, as a result of overcoming challenges while being a part of your team, and they thank you for holding their feet to the fire;Your employees come to you seeking coaching and guidance on how to overcome challenges and obstacles;Your employees want to contribute first, for they understand the concept of creating ""win/win/win"" for all involved: customers, employers and employees.And you the employer are always in charge - not the other way around!- That's ""Being"" a Leader!This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.Our workforce is not getting any younger. You have no choice but to hire millennials.Organizations that figure out how to manage Millennials will survive and thrive.Managers who gain the skill of being able to hire, manage and lead Millennials will be highly sought after by successful organizations.You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""!

It was formed nationally 40 years ago in 1983.   The organisation champions women in business, encourages women to achieve more satisfying careers and promotes women as vital contributors to the Irish economy. It liaises with national and international organisations and creates links with Government and State bodies.The most valued benefits of joining an organisation like this is the chance to network with other like-minded, dynamic women both locally and nationally, exchanging ideas, collaborating, offering and receiving support, building long term business relationships and increasing business contacts.  The organisation also aims to motivate, educate and inspire women to bring back energy, drive and enthusiasm to their businesses. Monthly events are organised to support, encourage and educate members while collaborating with like-minded people and organisations. Two other fantastic benefits of this organisation are it's mentoring and awards programmes.  Giving access to experts and recognition for your business achievements on a national scale.  As Network Ireland is a national organisation one of the key differences to other local networks is the access to events and other dynamic business women and business leaders in all of the branches nationwide, plus 2 Annual national conferences, where internationally renowned speakers will inspire and educate.","['Ireland Events', 'Carlow Events', 'Things to do in Carlow', 'Carlow Networking', 'Carlow Business Networking', '#networking', '#womeninbusiness', '#womennetworking', '#networkireland', '#networkirelandcarlow']",Free

This CIPD in person event will focus on two key strands for employee retention and enhanced business performance namely Talent & Performance Management. This will be achieved through an insightful presentation from an industry leading Pharmaceutical company, followed by a fireside chat with three industry leaders and a closing Q&A session. We expect this to be an event with many practical takeaways for attendees.   Talent management seeks to attract, identify, develop, engage and retain individuals and is a critical activity as people are an organisations most important asset and are key to the success of any business. To be effective, it needs to align with strategic business objectives. By managing talent strategically, organisations can build a high-performance workplace, foster a learning climate, add value to their employer brand, and improve diversity management.Our keynote speaker, Mark Nolan, Executive Director, HR Lead for MSD Ireland, will outline MSD’s approach to Talent Management, which is a newly evolved process encapsulating learnings from past experiences, industry best practice, current business objectives and the evolution of the world of work over the last few years, particularly with the changes brought about from the pandemic & the increasing mix of generations in our workforce. The new process, has an overarching theme of ‘Continuous Development for All’ and this should be a very practical insight into how MSD lives Talent Management as a key priority for its business should be aware of when employee performance is not reaching the required expectations. Our panel, compromising of Mark Nolan, Jennifer O’Sullivan, Director, Employee Relations at VMware & Ken Murphy, Director of Careerwise Recruitment will then participate in a fireside style discussion exploring the importance of Performance & Talent Management and fostering an awareness that not all “one size fits all” approach works when employee performance is not reaching the required expectations.

The cafés are open to all colleagues, and you can pick and choose the sessions of interest to you!

People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will:Appear (and feel!) more confident when you present. Speak in a natural, conversational way so that you feel more relaxed.Express your natural creativity and personality quirks so that you feel genuine and authentic.Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Build trust and rapport fastHold people’s attention when they have a million online distractions  Can communicate abstract ideasThirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will:  View you as their #1 expertImplement more of your ideasBuy more of your stuffAre you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home.FAQsIs this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location?Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them. Where can I access the masterclass?You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link within 24hr of the masterclass beginning. In the event that David is not available on the 25th, you will be sent a link to a recording of a previous session.The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis? No. The same series is repeated every month. You only need to attend one event.","['United Kingdom Events', 'Belfast Events', 'Things to do in Belfast', 'Belfast Classes', 'Belfast Business Classes']",Free

I tell them: ""What sort of a Millennial are you? There is nothing Millennial about you! You are giving the rest of them Millennials a bad name:-) You know what, as far as being a Millennial is concerned, you are FIRED!"" They giggle and tell me: ""Thanks, that's the best compliment I've ever got.""Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""?

A ""Millennial""? :-)The Emperor Has No Clothes On!Millennials have been told a pack of lies, and they are suffering from the spell.You the employer, sadly, have not been told the truth either.Everyone in America is beating around the bush, refusing to come out and say it: ""The Emperor is butt naked!!!""How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge?In this 1 hour on-demand webinar, you will learn the truth the whole truth and nothing but the naked inconvenient truth:1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.)2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.)3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.)4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-) 5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?)6.

(Hint: if you have troublemakers on your team? you know you've been scammed! Fool me once? Fool me twice?)What sort of job interview questions will help you figuring out who is telling the truth?You will learn 1 more important concept in this 1 hour on-demand webinar: How to Establish a Whole New Narrative with Your Employees:And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite:Your employees understand: true confidence, real self esteem, can only be earned, by overcoming challenges, by practicing fear busting and by expanding their own comfort zones.Your employees understand that ""growth"" doesn't mean ""I've been given more goodies for free"". They understand ""growth"" means they've busted more fears and expanded their comfort zones.You employees cherish the challenges you give them, because they understand overcoming challenges is the only way to grow.Your employees are grateful for their growth, both professionally and personally, as a result of overcoming challenges while being a part of your team, and they thank you for holding their feet to the fire;Your employees come to you seeking coaching and guidance on how to overcome challenges and obstacles;Your employees want to contribute first, for they understand the concept of creating ""win/win/win"" for all involved: customers, employers and employees.And you the employer are always in charge - not the other way around!- That's ""Being"" a Leader!This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.Our workforce is not getting any younger.

Participants share their professional backgrounds and business goals.We know that entering a room full of people, most of whom you’ve never met before, and engaging in small talk can be daunting especially if you’re feeling stressed and not particularly social on the day, but how will you expand your network if you don’t talk to anyone else?  Worse, if you’ve conjured up the courage to engage with someone new, you could find yourself suffering through the life story of the wrong business connection because you’re too polite to end the conversation.This event is an invaluable and an effective way to expand your connections, uncover new business opportunities, get introduced to all the potential partners and new clients and tap into trusted resources or service providers that can help you or your business.This networking event is designed to accelerate business contacts through facilitated introductions and conversations – at speed with a common structure to rotate all participants in quick succession so that each person gets the chance to engage one on one with as many people as possible.If you want a genuinely exciting and extremely beneficial networking experience outside of your usual networking meetings, then please do join us.!Make sure you:• bring lots of business cards• present your business succinctly getting straight to the point due to the time limit • make sure you know what to ask the other person• clearly communicate your interest to connect and follow up after the eventWe look forward to seeing you there!Team B2B Growth Hub, Isle of Man",[],

Fringe Lab, Sycamore Building, Sycamore Street, Temple Bar, Dublin 2 on Friday evenings from 7:30 pm until 9:00 pm

With Sahaja Yoga Meditation, we usually sit on chairs to achieve yoga effortlessly & spontaneously. So there is no need for mats or special clothing.

All across the globe, many are seeking new sources of energy. Meanwhile, the most transformative energy is hiding in plain sight within us, and it's natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable.

It's called inner kundalini energy. And everyone already has it — everyone!. It is often likened to an inner feminine or motherly energy which automatically knows about us and what is needed to help us restore balance and harmony within our subtle being. It works spontaneously, effortlessly, organically, and cannot be paid for.

Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple, time-honoured technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself — emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually.

If you're having trouble juggling the challenges in your life, Sahaja Yoga Meditation might help you manage stress, master your emotions and find solutions to your problems. You may enjoy better health, better focus, and a deeper understanding of the universe and your place in it.

Meditation is not just for mystics and monks. Sahaja Yoga meditation is for everyone. Anyone can do it. It's that easy. But with the Sahaja Yoga experience, you'll quickly realise it isn't your typical Meditation. It's much more than just feeling peaceful and relaxed. Sahaja Yoga Meditation has many layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your way. Our volunteer experts are always available to help.

Ready to plug into your inner energy? A few minutes of your life may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy and light the path to lifelong transformation. It's all about energy — guaranteed pure and carbon neutral, and you can never have too much of it.

The best part? All classes are free. No strings, no catch.

Everyone is welcome. Bring a friend, bring yourself — all are welcome.Our website: www.freemeditation.ie","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Classes', 'Dublin Health Classes', '#free', '#meditation', '#free_event', '#meditation_workshop', '#meditation_for_beginners', '#meditation_class', '#sahaja_yoga']",Free

The spring fills the meadows with the pink heads of wildflowers and new grasses. I﻿NTENTIONThe energy of the full moon is an opportunity to celebrate and express gratitude for the abundance in your life, to manifest the things you have worked towards, and let go of the things holding you back. WHAT TO EXPECTFull moon circle • Guided Meditation • Ceremonial grade cacao • Healing sounds • Sharing circleCACAO is a natural and ancient plant medicine for both the physical heart and the heart energy centre (anahata chakra). It's used in ceremonies to open the heart space, awaken the senses, and activate the heart chakra in order to begin inner healing. Cacao gives us access to higher energies such as love, connection, and joy. It provides clarity and helps to release limiting beliefs, fears, emotional blockages, and so on, by increasing self-awareness and emotional intelligence.SOUND HEALING is a powerful therapy that combines different healing sounds, music, and special healing instruments to improve our multidimensional well-being (body, mind, soul, spirit) leaving us feeling balanced and refreshed. Deep relaxation is the most significant benefit of sound healing, followed by its energetic deep tissue massage effect caused by the sound vibrations that open, clear, and balance the chakras, whilst releasing stuck energy.Contact details:  Nicole Hara Phone: +353 83 864 3289 or e-mail: nicolehara.33@gmail.comInstagram: @nicolehara.33 Arrive on time so that we can make the most use of our time together.WHAT TO BRING:WaterYour favourite mug to drink cacaoYoga mat and extra layer to cover yourself during the sound bathYour intention for the ceremonyWear comfortable clothesNotebook and pen for journalingSpecial items to charge in the altar (flowers, herbs, crystals, oracle deck, any special items)HOW TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE CACAOPlease avoid heavy food such as meat, and alcohol from the day before.Avoid caffeinated drinks or any stimulants like coffee, tea or energy drinks the day of the event.Make sure to drink plenty of water both before and after the ceremony to stay hydrated.Recommendation: do not eat at least 3 hours prior to the ceremony. This is so the cacao can be quickly absorbed, enabling you to go deeper into your journey.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Other', 'Dublin Health Other', '#meditation', '#cacao', '#soundbath', '#soundhealing', '#fullmoon', '#cacaoceremony', '#guided_meditation', '#fullmoonceremony', '#sound_healing', '#cacao_ceremony']",

All poses are done on the ground. Yin is a deeply meditative practice. It is an excellent practice to help with sleep. It can be more challenging mentally than physically. Open to all bodies.

The aim of this class is deep relaxation at the level of the nervous system.

when we are nervous or feel threatened our body and mind adapt to this state of affairs through an alert state, which is a perfect adaptation, the problem is that in today's world, through excess stimulation and stress, our nervous system hardly ever returns to normal a calm state, which after some time will lead us to a state of chronic stress, which is the cause of many diseases and is of great importance for our well-being.

In weekly classes, we will work in a somatic way on returning to a state of calm at the level of the body and nervous system.

Benefits of the class :

- Releasing the stress from the body 
- support of healing chronic pain 
- knowledge of self-regulation of emotional states 

It is proven TRE can be very beneficial for people suffering from anxiety and depression, however, it is always better if you advise your therapist about joining the class. 


TRE®is a body-based (somatic) process that, when done properly, through a Certified TRE Provider can allow the individual to discharge tension from the body, which often does not require “revisiting the story”. (ie: verbally describing or talking about the traumatic experience)

about me

I am a certified TRE® provider, and I also have a Master's Degree in Biology and Environmental science, In my practice, I am taking a holistic approach base on science.

Once we have this research, how can it be successfully translated into practice? While evidence-based design has refocused attention on the relationship between the built environment and wellbeing, it also tends to obscure knowledge from other disciplines, and from history, that would otherwise enrich contemporary understandings of this relationship. In this talk, she'll discuss the different theoretical frameworks being used to understand how the built environment impacts wellbeing, drawing upon examples from her own work across various paediatric, palliative and mental health care settings.Dr Rebecca McLaughlan, PhD, is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Architecture, Design and Planning, the University of Sydney, Australia.

The beat of the drum triggers something very deep in the subconscious, it brings us back to a deep memory of warmth protection and safety. Shamanic journey is very similar to meditation yet very different. Each individual in the group whilst receiving the same guidance will have a completely different experience. Yet in my experience there is always cross over in every group which goes to show how connected we all are.Shamanic journey has often been referred to as Shamanic Divination as it is through the use of symbols that spirit will communicate with us and give us guidance and advice to the problems that we are seeking help for. I will guide the group to the Shamanic lower world which is a place where we connect with spirit guides, spirit animals, and ancestral guides. Through our connection with our guides we will not only receive healing and wisdom but tools for protection and insight.The more we interact with our guides the stronger our connection becomes and the more we will see them working on our behalf.

What is IET? Integrated Energy Therapy® (IET®)",February 18 · 6pm - December 18 · 6pm GMT,D15 A89W 17 The Drive Hansfieldwood D15 A89W Dublin 15,"Please read important info till end.About this eventAn opportunity to learn Basic, Intermediate and Advance level of IET in one weekend.What is IET?Integrated Energy Therapy® (IET®) is one of the next generation – hands on – power energy therapy systems that get the “issues out of your tissues” for good! Developed at the Center of Being, by Stevan J. Thayer, IET uses the violet angelic energy ray, as brought to us through the nine Healing Angels of the Energy Field, to work directly with your 12 Strand Spiritual DNA. IET supports you in safely and gently releasing limiting energy patterns of your past, empowering and balancing your life in the present, and helps you to reach for the stars as you evolve into your future. We chose the term “Integrated” in our name to convey our healing vision of “integrating the pain of the past, into the power of the present, to bring about the joy of the future”. We have been privileged to see Integrated Energy Therapy live up to this vision.The IET® Mission is to “Heal the world one-heart-at-a-time”. Since 1994 when Stevan began teaching IET® he asked the angels to help spread IET beyond its origins in New Jersey to New York, or even New England. The angels have done this and more. Today there are IET students in 75 countries including Australia, Croatia, Hungary, Denmark, Guatemala, Nepal, Slovenia, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. We are truly honoured and blessed by what the angels (and the IET Master-Instructor Earth Angels) have done.Basic LevelOur Basic Level Integrated Energy Therapy® Training class:Prerequisites: This is our entry-level class and there are no prerequisites required for attendance at this class.Description: Even though we call this class “basic level” this class provides you with everything you need to do a powerful Integrated Energy Therapy® session on yourself or on another person (either in person or absentee). This class has been designed to be a wonderful entry level class for those students wanting to use energy therapy to heal their lives, an ideal class for students wanting to begin an energy therapy practice, and it provides a wonderful complement to other holistic techniques such as Massage, Reiki, and Therapeutic Touch. Only IET Master-Instructors are authorized to teach this class.Basic Attunement: You will receive a special Basic Level “energy attunement” that will permanently open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic level ray. Our Basic Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 1st pair (physical) and 2nd pair (emotional) of your 12 Strand DNA. Once attuned to the Basic Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to clear cellular memory of physical and emotional blockages.Angelic Heartlinks: Integrated Energy Therapy® is known as “Healing with the Energy of Angels”. You will learn to access the energy of angels through a simple yet powerful process that we call a Heartlink.A “heartlink” is a connection made with the angelic realm in which you visualize a golden chord going from your heart, through your throat, up through your head and then up to the angelic realm or to a specific angel, usually Angel Ariel or one of the other “Healing Angels of the Energy Field”. Once your Heartlink has been established, you will learn how to send love up to the angelic realm or that specific angel and you will find that the love returned is multiplied from the angels to further assist you in the healing of yourself or others. This Heartlink is invaluable in and of itself, however, when it is used in conjunction with the accessing of the energy system, it becomes extremely powerful and effective.The Magic Presence by M. DaCamara, copyright 1942 St. Germain Press, is a good depiction of a HeartlinkClearing Cellular Memory: you will learn about the nine cellular memory areas where we can unconsciously store “issues in our tissues” that can negatively affect our life. More importantly, you will learn simple yet powerful techniques to get the issues out of your tissues (as well as out of the tissues of others). Clearing of cellular memory is made quick and easy by means of nine sets of Integrated Energy Therapy® Integration Points that allow you to energize, integrate, and clear the nine cellular memory areas.Special Empowerment Imprints: In Integrated Energy Therapy® clearing harmful energy blocks is only half the task. After energy blocks are cleared, you will learn to channel angelic energy to form an empowerment imprint that fills the cellular memory with the opposite of what you cleared. For example, you will learn to clear the energy of guilt and imprint the energy of innocence.Class Length: 1 day (approx. 8 hours). This class is designed to be taught in one day, and typically runs from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. The actual length and times of class vary by individual Integrated Energy Therapy® Master-Instructors.Class Materials: you will receive a fully illustrated 26 page Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic Level Guide and an official Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic Level Certificate.Intermediate Level Our Intermediate Level Integrated Energy Therapy® Training class:Prerequisites: Completion of the Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic Level class is required for attendance at this class.Description: This class is the next step in our Integrated Energy Therapy® training system and it builds on all of the knowledge and techniques learned in our Basic Level training. Our Intermediate Level training expands upon both the depth and the breadth of the Basic Level techniques through the Intermediate Attunement (which opens you to clear mental and karmic imprints) and through the special Integrated Energy Therapy® pullout-release technique that lets you clear imprints from the human energy field. Only IET Master-Instructors are authorized to teach this class.Intermediate Attunement: You will receive a special Intermediate Level “energy attunement” that will further open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level ray. Our Intermediate Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 3rd pair (mental) and 4th pair (karmic) of your 12 Strand DNA. Once attuned to the Intermediate Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to pull physical, emotional, mental, and karmic energy imprints out of the human energy field.Clearing The Human Energy Field: You will learn the special Integrated Energy Therapy® pullout-release technique that will turn your hands into “energy magnets” that will allow you to easily attract and clear harmful energy imprints from the human energy field. This will allow you to clear even more difficult energy blockages. As part of this training, you will also be taught to feel and interpret energy blockages and identify the level (physical, emotional, mental, or karmic) that the energy blockages occur. You will also learn the special “pink bubble technique” that will further accelerate the clearing process.Class Length: 1 day (approx. 8 hours). This class is designed to be taught in one day, and typically runs from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. The actual length and times of class vary by individual Integrated Energy Therapy® Master-Instructors.Class Materials: You will receive a fully illustrated 26 page Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level Guide and an official Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level Certificate.Advanced LevelOur Advanced Level Integrated Energy Therapy® Training class:Prerequisites: Completion of the Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level class is required for attendance at this class.Description: This class builds on all of the knowledge and techniques learned in our Basic and Intermediate Level trainings. While our Basic and Intermediate Level classes are focused on clearing cellular memory and the human energy field, our Advanced Level training is focused on helping you live your soul’s mission and bringing your dreams alive. Only IET Master-Instructors are authorized to teach this class.Advanced Attunement: You will receive a special Advanced Level “energy attunement” that will further open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy Therapy® Advanced Level ray. Our Advanced Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 4th pair (soul profile) and 5th pair (soul cluster) of your 12 Strand DNA. Once attuned to the Advanced Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to discover your soul’s mission and attract members of your soul’s cluster to help you live your soul’s mission and bring your dreams alive.Your Soul’s Mission: Every soul incarnates with a special mission that is not only perfect for that soul but is an integral part of the higher divine plan. The Advanced Level energy attunement will open you to a deeper connection with your 8th chakra (called the soul star) where the complete plan for your soul’s mission is stored. You will learn how to tap into the soul star energy and better understand your soul’s mission through the creation of a vision board. You will also learn about the four E’s of living your soul’s mission and how energy blockages can prevent you from living your mission.Muscle Tension – Relaxation Techniques: The deep energy blockages that can prevent you from living your soul’s mission can easily be released through the special Advanced Level Integrated Energy Therapy® muscle tension – relaxation techniques. These techniques applied to the arms and legs will accelerate you in the living of your soul’s mission.Soul Star Clearing: This Advanced Level technique lets you work directly with the 8th chakra to activate the energy of the soul’s mission and focus angelic energy to bring your dreams alive.Heartbeams – Healing the Earth: As an Advanced Level practitioner, you will be able to give back to Mother Earth by establishing columns of Integrated Energy Therapy® energy into the Earth called Heartbeams. Once established, these columns provide a permanent anchor of angelic healing energy into the Earth. These can be used to heal areas of the Earth that have suffered from human or natural devastation. Not only will Heartbeams offer healing to the Earth, but they will also offer healing to anyone who passes through them. As an Advanced Level Integrated Energy Therapy® practitioner, you can place Heartbeams in your home and office. You can also place them at the entrances to schools, hospitals, train stations, airports, and anywhere lots of people will pass through.Class Materials: you will receive a fully illustrated 34 page Integrated Energy Therapy® Advanced Level Guide and an official Integrated Energy Therapy® Advanced Level Certificate.Cost of the Course: 450 euroTo book a place you can use below link and deposit 25 euro and the rest can be paid on the day.Please pay by Revolut or Paypal link to make payment https://paypal.me/BinduKharbandaVenue: 2 mins from Clonsilla Train StationFor further details contact Bindu on 0892472573 Sattvic Yogic Lunch and refreshments are included.

It is good to wear clothing that allows free movement, yoga mats are not necessary. Chairs and cushions are provided but if you have a favourite cushion, blanket and pair of warm socks you are welcome to bring them along!Date and time: Friday, 28 April 2023, 6.30-8pmLocation: Rigpa centre, 3rd Floor, 12 Wicklow Street, Dublin 2  (entrance: glass door to the left of shop)Cost:  By donation (suggested donation EUR 20). Your donation, whatever the amount, is greatly appreciated. It will support the activity of the centre and help us to keep offering more events, courses and workshops like these in the future. BiographyMatt Padwick has been practising meditation and Kum Nye since 1998 when he first arrived at Dzogchen Beara, the Tibetan Buddhist retreat centre in West Cork. He completed two years of closed retreat at Dzogchen Beara and then worked in a variety of roles including Centre Director from 2003-2013, and now offers Kum Nye programmes at Dzogchen Beara and elsewhere in Ireland.Matt’s search for moments of pure mind and perfect balance was not without incident… He is the author of two autobiographical novels; “Running Contra Diction” (2015) and “Transpose” (2017) which contrast the insecurity that powered a life of extreme sport and wilderness adventure, with the more satisfying alternative founded on inner peace and contentment.What others are saying“I’ve been going through a busy and transitional time of life lately and desperately needed find my way back to my body and the present moment.

Working with the current energy of the New Moon offers us the opportunity to come back into balance, into alignment with our own natural rhythms. When we are in a state of flow we can feel more calm, balanced, grounded, sleep better, have better digestion, less busy minds, and be able to tackle life's ups and downs with more ease and flow!_________________________________________Will all the meditation and musing sessions be the same?Each New or Full Moon Meditation & Musing will vary from month to month; focusing on the energy, astrology and characteristics of that Moon Cycle.

 I’m owner of Hypnosis Blanchardstown Clinic. Being a hypnotherapist it is very important for me to understand and work on the subject of Mind. Hypnosis I believe is the most powerful way of healing by using power of your subconscious mind.

Integrated Energy Therapy® (IET) sessions use angelic energy to work directly with your body’s cellular memory and energy field to get the “issues out of your tissues” for good. IET helps you to safely and gently release limiting energy patterns from your past, empower and balance your life in the present, and embody your full potential as you move into your future.

I help my clients achieve a satisfactory result and clear their blockages so that they can achieve their purpose of life to full potential and align energy to higher vibrations. I also help them in dealing with addictions, nail-biting, quit smoking, weight loss, anxiety, low self-esteem and many more.

I’m also Meditation Practitioner and Teacher and having an Indian background and knowledge of scriptures, mantras and spirituality I like to incorporate all these in my classes. I work with different Meditation technique with Shiv and Shakti (Universal Source and Soul power), Light meditation and chant of Durga Saptashati to align the Kundalini which is a Meditation practice.

About Kundalini Reiki :This is a straightforward healing technique which does not require intensive study or the use of complex procedures. Its a very safe way to awaken the Kundalini energy.

There are 3 attunements given in order to open you as a channel for the energy to heal yourself and others. This is possible the only attunement process able to open both the Universal and Earth energies at the same time which enable the practitioner to become a very powerful conduit for healing and transform energy.

Kundalini word is Sanskrit means ""Snake"" or "" Serpent Power"". It is the energy of the Consciousness, a great reservoir of creative energy, which is thought to reside within the sleeping body. It is aroused either through spiritual discipline, many times through yoga or meditation, that prepares the body for the awakening, spontaneously, or through a guru to bring new states of consciousness including mystical illumination.

It is possible to accelerate your personal development and spiritual growth by opening the Kundalini Centre promoting enlightenment and a feeling of bliss and oneness. The Root or the Base Chakra, which is the energy centre located near the base of the spine, acts as an entrance for the Kundalini energy also know as Kundalini fire. Upon entering the body, the energy runs all the way up through the body, through the main energy channel, before exiting the Crown Chakra. An open Kundalini means that over a period of time, a complete cleansing of the chakras, the body parts, and the energy channels is obtained.

In Kundalini Reiki, knots and blocks in the chakras are removed and the body is prepared for the full Kundalini Awakening that takes place in accordance with the soul's divine blueprint.

It's thought that when we are in the womb, the Kundalini energy starts at the crown Chakra and travels down to the base of the spine creating our form and our Consciousness. From birth on, we are striving for the Kundalini to return to it's original position taking us back to the time we were filled with love ad wonder for everything.

Sometimes the image of the Snake along with the stories of the ""dangerous"" side effects of an awakening can be intimidating. Sometimes it might be more helpful to see the snake as transformative energy, and as the Kundalini energy moves through your body it is transforming your consciousness. Unconscious material remains unconscious precisely because it is uncomfortable to the conscious mind. Therefore, even in the best of circumstances, the joy associated with the awakening of the Kundalini can be attended with a Certain amount of anxiety as the unconscious contents spills over into consciousness.

Kundalini Reiki is a healing modality but also a personal transformation helping you become aware of the changes you want in life and assisting in creating your desires. It gets you in touch with your higher self. When we are in tune with our higher self, we have more clarity and insights and able to find answers within. And more clearly can see the reason behind why an old wound won't heal.

Kundalini Reiki helps give you the courage to heal. It gives insight into what you want to manifest, the courage to move ahead and ask for what you want, and the flexibility to get out of your own way.

Our individual Kundalini called Kundala is in effect the same energy as the Earth's Kundala energy- this means when our energy is awoken then we can know our souls role in the co-evolution of humankind and the World Mother. World/Cosmic Mother Gaia/ Sophia.

BE PREPARED FOR CHANGE:

Be sure that Kundalini Reiki is right for you before you have an attunement. It is an irreversible process. Once you have awoken your Kundalini fire, it will continue to cause change in your life. However, the Universe will never give you any energy or situation that you cannot handle. Treat the Kundalini with respect and reverence for it is a powerful transformation tool. Be responsible for the increase in personal power you may feel after the attunement. Be ready for this and use it wisely. The changes that take place will all be for your highest good.",[],€27.55

The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words – Rei which means “God’s Wisdom or the Higher Power” and Ki which is “life force energy”. So Reiki is actually “spiritually guided life force energy.” Reiki works balancing the chakra system. The word ‘chakra’ means wheel in Sanskrit. They are energetic centers and we have 7 main chakras located from the base of our spine to the top of our head keeping both, our physical and spiritual bodies connected. It addresses the whole person, rather than targeting the individual symptoms and can create profound, often subtle shifts from deep within your own being. What many people enjoy about reiki treatment is that it allows them time for themselves where they aren’t ‘doing’ but they are just ‘being’.This is a very powerful session and will leaving you feeling rejuvenated and restored.

I couldn't recommend the Karl Anthony Method enough the difference it has made to my life after only a few sessions with Karl. I went to Karl because I struggled with anxiety and health anxiety I was always in fight or flight mode, waiting for something to happen. My health anxiety had me monitoring my body for any changes I could feel. I was due to have an operation the end of August that's when I knew I needed Karl's help after a previous operation were I had a cardiac arrest so I was petrified. Karl was so comforting telling me everything would be ok. The week of the operation I was so shocked at how calm I was feeling about it. The morning of the operation I was still feeling so calm. The doctors came in to check me before surgery but they couldn't find anything I was even sent for a CT scan all was clear. I really can not thank Karl enough for all he has done for me. Since attending Karl I haven't felt any anxiety or panic at all and I am really enjoying having my freedom back.",[],€197

Do you blame yourself for everything?	Are you afraid of failure?Lacking self-esteem, you unfortunately become your own enemy, maybe even your worst enemy. Self-criticism can lead one to feelings of sadness, indecisions, shame or guilt. You may constantly miss opportunities and suffer with regrets. A person with low self-esteem can be more prone to addictions and insecurities because such a person is missing the most important thing they should be counting on to make their dreams come true: their own self-worth and abilities. Is it possible to change this?Fortunately, the answer is YES. But it's not done by wishful thinking. If that worked it would have changed it already. It is only possible when you understand what is causing you to not believe in yourself and how to overcome that barrier. Attend my talk and start gaining a new best friend: YOU!

I was inspired by spiritual books I'd read and wanted to share teachings. Then after a year I started writing my own meditations and prompts and incorporating them into my events. What started as a hobby has became my main job and to date i've done readings for over 500 women over the course of 4 years and have created my own Talk, Tarot & Tea oracle deck.I also offer 1/1 online and in-person tarot and oracle readings in the areas of relationships, finance, career and many other topics.

Harder than you thought? I feel that... been there.  Meditation used to be challenging for me – how do you turn down your and be one with your  intentions?  It wasn’t until I attended  my first sound bath that everything changed.  Feeling the sounds and vibrations flow through me, I had never felt so at peace, so at ease.  All the stress in my body melted away. I was finally able to relax, channel my thoughts, and focus on the now.WHAT IS A SOUND BATH? I often find it hard to really describe the essence of a sound bath to someone who’s never been to one before, as it can truly be a unique experience for everyone.  All you have to do is show up with the intension to relax, get super cozy  laying down , and prepare yourself for a beautiful guided meditation led by crystal singing bowls .  The vibrations, sounds, and energy that fill the room are something you just have to experience for yourself to fully understand how magical yet therapeutic sound therapy can be. Everything on earth has a vibrational frequency  including our bodies. And every part of our bodies resonates in a certain way.  We always want to be at our “Highest Vibration,” however, sometimes certain parts of our body can become unbalanced or blocked, which can result in anxiety, stress, and even illness.  It is my job as a sound practitioner to set positive intentions based on your needs and allow the crystal bowls to sing those powerful, healing vibrations of theirs.  These intentional sound waves will flow through you, resonating with your different Chakras, and allow the body to harmonize and balance itself back to a healthy state of vibration. While this form of sound therapy is meant to relax and destress, possibly even taking you into a sleep-like state, the way the vibrations harmonize within your body, it can also be a very energizing and empowering sensation – so be open to all emotions you might feel, as this is your body’s way of telling you what it needs.  Hold the space for what you need, and let go of the rest.During this crystal reiki sound bath not only will you benefit from the healing properties of the sounds and vibrations, but also from the crystals and essential oils thoughtfully selected for each meditation.  I create the most perfect collections of crystals into my sound baths, and we will use these crystals in partnership with sound to bring you a beautiful and unique Sound Bath experience.  So please join me as we deepen your meditation, relaxation, and overall well-being through this full mind, body, and soul experience.  And feel free to stay after for some tea and good vibes So come learn a powerful technique using crystals to cleanse your aura and release negative energy from your body and mind  you will cleanse your aura with a high vibrational crystal while being immersed in the vibrations of a Sound Bath. I want all of you to continue using this aura cleansing technique on a daily basis, so you will be able to take your special crystal home with you after class!   You will relax into a crystal sound bath meditation  with a warm neck wrap and eye pillow . During the meditation, I will perform a Reiki Healing over each person in the class.  Reiki is an energy healing technique in which Reiki practitioners use gentle touch to deliver energy to your body. Reiki promotes relaxation and reduces stress and anxiety by improving the flow and balance of energy. Sound therapy or acoustic healing involves  sound bowls  to create soundwaves that penetrate the body at the cellular level bringing a sense of calm and relaxation. This workshop combines Reiki and sound therapy to help guide the body and mind into a deep state of relaxation where physical, emotional, and energetic healing can occur.

Often Sound Healing is a very gentle way to enter into different parts of our bodies and when combined with meditation can offer up a safe space to gently release what no longer serves us. When our hearts are opened this allows for an easier ability to heal ourselves. We can release blocks, stagnation, recognize patterns and listen to our heart more easilyConnecting to your highest self, truth, and soulCeremonial grade cacao  is a beautiful heart opening  medicine  that is known as the  ""food of the gods"" containing high amounts of magnesium, antioxidants(vitamin A, C & E, beta-carotene and manganese), flavanols, potassium, and theobromine. For one, it is reported to actually aid sleep and relaxation. It does this through one of its active ingredients - magnesium. Magnesium is a natural relaxant that helps deactivate adrenaline and is said to quiet nerves and calm sensitivity  to pain.Ceremonial grade cacao, is also thought to be a source of tryptophan, an amino acid that gets turned into the neurotransmitter serotonin and then converted into the hormone melatonin.Serotonin is known as the “happy chemical” and raw cacao boosts the body’s natural production of it, increasing mood and ability to fend off stress.Why combine Cacao, Sound Healing, and Reiki?Why not? I love to combine these three modalities of healing, we can experience a more powerful healing. This allows us to gently let go of what doesn't serve us and experience what is needed for our growth, healing, soul/spirit, and ultimately our day to day life.Our studio will be candlelit and the use of essential oils will be used to enhance this blissful experienceP﻿lease bringY﻿oga matB﻿lanketE﻿ye mask P﻿illowL﻿ooking forward to this wonderful eveningL﻿ove AvrilT﻿his event has been improved I have added yoga  and live music  with chanting and increased the event to 3 hours ","['Ireland Events', 'Wicklow Events', 'Things to do in Wicklow', 'Wicklow Parties', 'Wicklow Health Parties', '#yoga', '#reiki', '#soundbath', '#crystalsingingbowls', '#cacaoceremony', '#crystal_healing']",

The owners grow much of their own food here, and it's a great setting for yoga, writing, walking, swimming in the sea (image is the cliffs near the blowhole to the left of Rhoscolyn beach) and some great food. The site is 5 minutes walk from three world-class beaches; Silver Bay, Shelly and Rhoscolyn and the campsite borders the dunes. There will be four yoga classes over the weekend. The classes will be carefully planned to suit everyone, 7am breathwork and morning swim followed by a morning yoga energising practice and a lovely yin and restorative in the evening. Our teacher is yoga and breathwork expert, Gavin DeMarines. Other activities and accommodation  We are offering one 60 min (optional but included!) writing workshop on Saturday - details TBC  - and there will be time for at least a couple of 1-2hr walks on Sat & Sun PM with one guided walk with Ruth on Saturday pm.

It is practised in over 126 countries around the world and the testimonials of personal healing and positive life transformation have been incredible .Meditating on the Twin Hearts enables the body to absorb a tremendous amount of energy which many refer to as Prana, Chi or life’s energy.  This has a flushing and cleansing effect, then stimulating and energizing effect through the practitioners’ system resulting in better physical, emotional and mental health.Improved health -Once the divine energy flows through you, it naturally flushes the used up and unwanted energies within your system; so after the meditation, you become a fresher ‘You’.Reduced stress, anxiety and depression -Twin Heart disintegrates the unwanted emotions and thought-forms within your chakras and aura. It makes positivity and happiness come naturally to you.Sharper mind and greater happiness -Once the unwanted thought forms and emotions are out of your system, your mind becomes clear and your emotions more refined.Increase your self-esteem -When you become more powerful, you can do much more; so it helps you build a good image of yourself.Improve your relationships -As you bless the entire earth with loving-kindness, you will be filled with love energy. This love brings harmony to your relationships. Become a divine channel -The meditation creates an opportunity for you to become a channel to bless everyone on earth with a better life. Increase good luck -Once you make yourself available to serve, you create lots of good karma that shows itself in life as good luck.

For some this is felt physically, for others it works on an emotional or mental level. The session may also be experienced in a more spiritual way.There is no set or specified way that one should experience a sound bath session.

At Systema we are eternal students. There is no other distinction made between practitioners beyond who is leading the class and who is taking part.Every person we practice with highlights different aspects of our own areas of physical, emotional & psychological tension and likewise we reflect our partners tension(s) back to them. Systema focuses specifically on understanding our own fears and applying this knowledge in situations of conflict or high pressure, making it an incredibly effective toolkit for navigating the complex and fast paced modern world we live in. The fundamental principles of Systema can be practiced by anyone regardless of age or ability. Instructors guide participants through a range of experiences in class and the skills learned there can be applied quickly in all areas of life for improving your physical and mental health. The four fundamental pillars we study to achieve this are:* breathwork* posture* movement & * relaxation. Classes cover all kinds of real life 'self defense' situations - multiple opponents, confined spaces, training in nature, weapons work etc There are no categories, grades or competitions; no uniforms to buy; katas or poses to learn. Instead, global concepts are studied and applied as opposed to developing individual techniques which may only work for one particular (often highly controlled, competitive)scenario. This is what truly characterises Systema as stand-alone from any other Martial Arts practice;It is the freedom to be your whole self at all times and the invitation to remain human whilst under threat.See you on the mats!F﻿AQs:How do I sign up?For health and safety and insurance reasons, we need to know how many people will be in the room, so y﻿ou will need to register in advance of the class.  You can either book through this event page, or you can just send an email to systemabelfast@gmail.com or respond to the facebook event as 'going' to reserve your place.  After the free trail, you're welcome to pay in cash if you prefer not to book online. W﻿hat should I wear to class?C﻿lasses are informal and you are encouraged to dress in comfortable, loose fitting clothing that will allow you to move with ease. Layers are also a good idea as the venue is old and the temperature can be quite changeable. H﻿ow fit do I have to be to take part?T﻿here is no standard of fitness required to participate.  Everything can be tailored and adapted to suit a broad range of needs and abilities.  The priority here is that you leave class feeling better than you came.  Since Systema is non competitive, classes aren't designed towards attaining levels of proficiency.  We all come with our own limitations and we are all working on our own outcomes.  I﻿f you do have accessibility requirements please do get in touch before booking as we are on the 2nd floor with no access to a lift. Email:  systemabelfast@gmail.comD﻿o I need to buy or bring anything else?N﻿o.  We will work across a variety of themes and topics.  In any instance where we are using props, these will be provided in class.  You may occasionally be asked to bring something from home if you happen to have it, like a football for example.  Training props or access to resources will never be a barrier between you and your training. W﻿hat age are classes for?T﻿hese classes specifically are for over 18s.  I am inviting expressions of interest for womens-only classes and also for parent/ teen classes.  If this sounds like something you are looking for, please get in touch.

Led by our leading Doctors of Chiropractic, who will look to identify abnormalities or dysfunction that may be occurring in or around your body. Our Doctors of Chiropractic will take the time to assess any postural issues you may have and will discuss if there are any underlying issues that may respond to treatment.We believe that health is among our most valuable possessions and that optimum health can be achieved, given time and the correct environment.At this event, a chiropractor will examine your spine to locate nerve interference and vertebral misalignment.There are FIVE key body signals that would indicate its time to check your spine: Back Pain that doesn't go awayFrequent migraines and headaches Sleeping problemsStiffness & lack of flexibilityLack of energy You Will learn: How good and bad posture impact you and your body beyond painWhich anatomical structures are causing any painWays to safely and effectively manage spine related symptoms What happens in a screening? We carry out a spinal screening - a simple method of bilateral measurements and weight distribution patterns to locate potential stress points in the skeletal structure that may be the cause of or lead to future pain and discomfort throughout the body.Who is this event for? This event is for EVERYONE, but specifically for anybody who has spinal related issues and suffers from back pain that doesn’t go away, consistent headaches and migraines, sleeping issues, stiffness and lack of flexibility or a lack of energy. When should I have my spine checked? There is no better time than now! It’s important to know what pain is common for you and what pain is abnormal. When your everyday aches and pains become more intense, it’s definitely time to see a specialist, but why wait until it gets to that point? Spine health begins with you, and the first step is being attentive to something that is out of the ordinary. Back pain and the symptoms of bad posture should not stop you from living your life or keep you from the activities that you love. By recognising the above problems, you are already taking a proactive step toward improving your spine health!EVERYONE is welcome, so come along and why not bring a family member or friend with you!

Last years show sold out fast so get on it.,"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 19:00 - 22:00 IST",Dunboyne Castle Castlefarm Dunboyne,"2022 is arguably the most successful year for “Damo” since 2000’s They Don’t Teach This Shit In School. Not content with a sold out tour of Ireland and the regions, Damien also played to a full house (and square) at London’s Electric Ballroom and the St Patricks Day Celebrations in Trafalgar Square. He will end the year with a run of shows and 5 sold out nights at Vicar Street in Dublin.The release of ‘Love Yourself Today’ gave an insight into his legendary Vicar Street Christmas shows but also the incredible bond he has with his fans and the undoubted healing power of his music. Following a number of individuals who have been strongly influenced by his message, beautifully shot new documentary ‘Love Yourself Today’ unearths their stories of overcoming pain and finding solace in his music. The film successfully explains the Dublin singer-songwriter’s appeal by focusing on what his songs mean to fans.“Singing and music are two of the few spiritual entities in the physical world, so we need to harness them and get people immersed in them,"" Dempsey explains, ""because when people lose themselves at a gig, when everyone sings together, they carry a vibration away from the gig that spreads out like a ripple into others, it’s a way of healing.""Damien Dempsey’s importance as a singer and songwriter of great passion, conviction and beauty has never been more prominent. He is that rare gem of an artist, an ex boxer – with the soul of a poet, whose heroes and influences are as diverse as Christy Moore, Shane McGowan, Luke Kelly and Bob Marley. With themes of addiction, loss but also hope and positivity, Dempsey’s music often reflects his fans' pain, alleviates their anguish and ultimately provides peace as they ‘sing all their cares away’.","['Ireland Events', 'Meath Events', 'Things to do in Dunboyne', 'Dunboyne Performances', 'Dunboyne Music Performances', '#damiendempsey', '#dunboynecastle']",

It is the culmination of a long tradition of Russian church music, and in particular the development of ‘choral orchestration’, summoning an enormous range of colour from the choir, and demanding virtuosity from all voices.Rachmaninov's All Night Vigil is truly a masterpiece, from a composer at the peak of his creative powers. Though it went largely unheard until the 1960s due to Bolshevik suppression of religious music, it has since earned its rightful place in the repertory, next to his symphonies, concertos and piano works.A﻿lso coming to Belfast on Friday 31st March.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#choir', '#choral', '#rachmaninoff', '#rachmaninov', '#classical_music', '#romantic_music']",€5 – €20

He was only 35. Though completed by others in his circle, and as with the Mass in C Minor, which he had mostly written by the mid 1780s, Mozart captures the drama and visceral emotion of the liturgy. Though much scholarly debate continues as to who completed the pieces, there is no escaping the magnificence and virtuosic demands of both, such that generations of artists have been inspired by these great masterpieces ever since.

The frst full-length album ""Tree of Lies"" was released on Zenon records - the infamous Australian psychedelic label.The album was a huge success for the particularly aggressive and heavy sound, building the bridge between the deepest of psychedelic trance textures, some call it ""forest"" and the ultimate “Zenonesque” sound.No matter what the title, the awe of experiencing a live Hypo-performance is second to none, anywhere around the globe.Currently, HypoGeo is working on the long awaited 2nd studio album; an epitome of creativity, abstract sonic landscapes, and undeniably intricate composition.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Parties', 'Dublin Music Parties', '#party', '#electronic_music', '#trance', '#psychedelic', '#psytrance', '#psy', '#zenon_records', '#psychedelic_gaff', '#dark_progressive', '#hypogeo']",From €11.11

As a 14 year old in Reykjavik, Ákadóttir began her musical career, exploring the vast universe of experimental music while retaining a massive heart at her core. Over the past 12 years, Ákadóttir has released 12 records, including as a member of Pascal Pinon and Samaris, collaborated with renowned artists Ólafur Arnalds and Damien Rice, scored the award-winning Icelandic film Backyard Village, and garnered fansacross the world – including Björk, who cites Ákadóttir as an inspiration.https://jfdrcurrent.com/N﻿icklas PashburgComposer and contemporary pianist Niklas Paschburg was born in Hamburg . Following his first EP “Tuur mang Welten”, he released his debut album in 2018. ‘Oceanic’ was a moving trip full of both melancholy and energy; twelve instrumental songs between neo-classical, ambient and electronic music, inspired by nature. This period was a defining experience for the young German composer, grown up as a pianist: “As a teenager I used to listen to Nils Frahm, Ólafur Arnalds, Hauschka and all that world, and my EP was influenced by those artists. Paschburg's music articulates the traces remote environments have left in Niklas’ mind – something pressing is present in the music, its urgency roams searching for sources of energy and relief. All these impressions come from a piece of music which is both melancholic and positive, something to cradle us from anxieties, to make us both dance and run.https://niklaspaschburg.com/-﻿-D﻿oors : 20.00T﻿ickets : €22.50 - €27.50  + FeesH﻿B x","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#homebeat', '#sugarclub', '#jfdr', '#nicklaspashburg']",From €24.71

Having already collaborated with acclaimed artists in the Irish and UK R&B scene, received impressive media coverage and with his latest single, 'Will you be back before dark?', receiving 20k+ streams and counting, the future looks bright for Pio.O﻿n 18th April 2023, for the first time ever, Pio will be unveiling his debut EP. Never one to do things by halves, Pio and his friends will perform the highly anticipated 9-track EP in its entirety, complete with a full band, featuring vocalists, violins, and more. Supporting Pio on the night will be Mullingar native Ellen Sleator, performing with her acclaimed band. Ever impossible to put in a box, her dreamy vocals and ethereal songwriting chart a path through R&B, pop, indie and melodic rap. Her captivating sound has seen her gain the attention of The Academic, with whom she recently finished touring as their selected opening act.P﻿RAISE FOR PIO HARTNETT""Pio was a dream for Low Light Sessions, he created a beautifully intimate atmosphere from the moment he started to the final goodbye, capturing the entire venue's attention and admiration""   - Eoghan O'Dowd (Venue Booker)  ""While Hartnett’s vocals are rich and bold, there is also something haunting in their soulful execution""   - Nicole Mendes, The Other Side Reviews  ""Nothing short of phenomenal""   - Sha, The Bops Collective  ""Astounding vocals and enchanting instrumentation""   - Karley Myall, Strike A NoteP﻿RAISE FOR ELLEN SLEATOR""groovy set with her dreamy vocals""- Hot Press""Ellen Sleator offers a gentle soft pop glow with tension baked into the production""- Nialler9--- O﻿VER 18s, ID REQUIRED ------ BOOK YOUR FREE TICKET ONLINE @ EVENTBRITE TO RESERVE YOUR PLACE ---e","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#music', '#indie', '#pop', '#irish', '#newmusic', '#irishmusic', '#supportlocalartists', '#alternativemusic', '#singer_songwriter', '#singers__live_music']",

Currently studying at BIMM in Dublin, Smith is already attracting plenty of attention for his clever, catchy, quirky and original songs and his equally quirky look.

In 2021, Smith teamed up with producer Dave Ayers (Studio 51) to record his debut album, titled Storyboard. It features 12 original tracks that showcase Smith’s incredible voice and invites the listener to peek inside his Alice in Wonderland mind where all sorts of magic and mayhem are sonically produced.

Smith’s musical theatre background serves him well both vocally and performance wise and although strongly influenced by artists such as Billy Joel and Jeff Lynn, his style is comparable to the genius of Jonathan Richmond and MIKA. Smith doesn’t have a self-conscious bone in his body and cares little about whether something is cool or not. He’s just happy to sing and that’s massively to his credit. His ability to take his audience down the rabbit hole on a magnificent sing-along joy ride is worth the money alone.

He releases his first single titled “Shotgun” on all streaming and download, platforms on April 7th. The official launch takes place in The Grand Social Dublin on April 18th when AaRoN Smith, accompanied by a full band, will play a number of tracks from his forthcoming album.

That trip turned into a mind-blowing trip and, since 1959, when the Time magazine published an article with the title “Spring Break”, mentioning the new point to hangout! Since then, this party has started to take place in different countries but always with the same proposal: enjoying a lot! MY TECH IS HOUSE is a label party foced on House Music and its variations, such as Acid House, Slap House, Afro House, Tech House and also Techno. House Music emerge from the resistance and the struggle for equality and against prejudice. Its structure is formed by the plurality and variety of sounds, people and thoughts. MY TECH IS HOUSE is not just a party, it is a rescue for diversity, union and, above all, mutual respect and for ideas. No clique groups, but we care about carrying some banners of cause.

This event is the second iteration of the Metaxu series, which focuses on music making, sharing and performance in relation to the idea of Metaxu as explored in the writings of the mystic philosopher Simone Weil. Across Weil’s writings, her ideas of attention, grace, beauty and decreation provide points of departure for approaching Metaxu . Following a tradition of theologically infused realism, the idea of Metaxu is one in which materiality exists as a mediator or bridge, between finite and infinite, between earthly and divine, between gravity and grace. For Weil, the crossing of this bridge is made possible by the practice of attention. This world is the closed door. It is a barrier. And at the same time it is the way through. This event explores musical experience - listening, making and performing, as a devotional practice of attention. Through the material of sound and the prism of music, our attention may be channelled to allow an inflow of a sense of the divine or infinite, of ‘grace’. This event intends to illuminate how as fellow contemporaries and performing artists with sonic and music making practices, we are always transforming and refining one another's experiences of attention and metaxu. There will be a publication as part of this event, featuring drawings by artist Cara Farnan and writing by artist Holly Pickering.

An avid songwriter since the age of 15, Peter grew up surrounded by music. After testing the waters with his original songs at a college open mic, Peter began properly recording his music at home in the summer of 2020. A few months later in October he released his debut single, “The End of The World”, an indie folk ballad filled with choral vocals and stirring, apocalyptic lyrics and instrumentation. Peter’s dramatic indie folk sound draws from a wide range of influences, drawing on the poeticism and varied sounds of artists such as Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, Hozier, Lorde and Ben Howard among countless others. Peter also draws influence from great Irish folk singer/songwriters, such as Paul Brady and Declan O’Rourke. Peter’s second single, “Please Don’t Believe Me” released in March of 2021, and further expanded his ambitious home-crafted sound. The “Gripping sophomore track” (Hot Press) was featured on RTÉ Radio 1 and Hot Press’ “Track of The Day” upon release. Indie Buddie remarked the track “oozes passion, compelling melodies, and cinematic appeal”, describing it as “a refined display of contemporary pop marking Peter Richardson an artist to keep an eye on.” Peter then went on to begin working with prolific cork producer Cian Sweeney (1000 Beasts) on his debut debut EP ‘Then & Now’, which released on July 10th 2022. This was followed shortly by his debut headline show in Whelan’s, which after selling out the upstairs venue weeks in advance was upgraded to the Main Room, and his debut festival performance at Kaleidoscope festival.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#events', '#gigs', '#ireland', '#dublin', '#ireland_events']",

Drawing on diverse sources - such as American and Italian folk music, early Baroque songs, classical arrangements of African American spirituals, original songs, and deconstructed arias - they show the fluidity between the classical and popular sound.Tickets €28 including booking fee.Doors open at 7.30pm for an 8pm start.Photograph credit - Ebru YildizAttendees who are expecting to take a taxi home after the concert are advised to book one in advance.BiographiesRhiannon GiddensAcclaimed musician Rhiannon Giddens uses her art to excavate the past and reveal bold truths about our present. A MacArthur “Genius Grant” recipient, Giddens co-founded the Grammy Award–winning Carolina Chocolate Drops, and she has been nominated for seven additional Grammys for her work as a soloist and collaborator. She most recently won the 2022 Grammy in the Best Folk Album category for They’re Calling Me Home, her collaboration with multi-instrumentalist Francesco Turrisi. The 12-track album was recorded in Ireland during the recent lockdown; it speaks of the longing for the comfort of home as well as the metaphorical “call home” of death, which has been a tragic reality for so many during the COVID-19 crisis.Giddens’s lifelong mission is to lift up people whose contributions to American musical history have previously been erased, and to work toward a more accurate understanding of the country’s musical origins. Pitchfork has said of her work, “Few artists are so fearless and so ravenous in their exploration,” and Smithsonian magazine calls her “an electrifying artist who brings alive the memories of forgotten predecessors, white and Black.”Among her many diverse career highlights, Giddens has performed for the Obamas at the White House, served as a Carnegie Hall Perspectives artist, and received an inaugural Legacy of Americana Award from Nashville’s National Museum of African American History in partnership with the Americana Music Association. Her critical acclaim includes in-depth profiles by CBS News Sunday Morning, The New York Times, The New Yorker, and NPR’s Fresh Air, among many others.Giddens is featured in Ken Burns’s Country Music series, which aired on PBS in 2019, where she speaks about the African American origins of country music. She is also a member of the band Our Native Daughters with three other Black female banjo players—Leyla McCalla, Allison Russell, and Amythyst Kiah—and co-produced their debut album Songs of Our Native Daughters, which tells stories of historic Black womanhood and survival.Named artistic director of Silkroad in 2020, Giddens is developing a number of new programs for the organization, including one inspired by the history of the American transcontinental railroad and the cultures and music of its builders. She recently wrote the music for an original ballet, Lucy Negro Redux, for Nashville Ballet (premiered in 2019), and the libretto and music for an original opera, Omar, based on the autobiography of the enslaved man Omar Ibn Said for the Spoleto USA Festival (premiered in 2022).As an actor, Giddens had a featured role on the television series Nashville.Francesco TurrisiGrammy Award–winning multi-instrumentalist Francesco Turrisi has been defined a “musical alchemist” and a “musical polyglot.” He left his native Italy in 1997 to study jazz piano and early music at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, where he obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Since 2004, he has been working successfully as a freelance musician. He was a member of the celebrated early music ensemble L’Arpeggiata, performing at the most important classical music festivals in Europe and around the world, and has recorded for the Warner, Virgin, Naïve, and Alpha labels.Turrisi has released five critically acclaimed albums as a leader and two as a co-leader, including Tarab, a cross-boundary innovative album that blends Irish and Mediterranean traditional music, and Zahr, a project that looks at connections between southern Italian traditional music and Arabic music. His latest piano solo album, Northern Migrations, was described as “delicate, wistful, and wholly engrossing” by The Irish Times. He performed selections from the album at a sold-out concert at Farmleigh in 2022.In 2018, Turrisi began to collaborate with American Grammy-winning singer and multi-instrumentalist Rhiannon Giddens. Together, the duo has released two critically acclaimed albums: their 2019 debut project there is no Other and They’re Calling Me Home, which earned the 2022 Grammy for Best Folk Album.Turrisi is equally at home playing with jazz veterans Dave Liebman and Gianluigi Trovesi as he is with Irish traditional sean-nós singer Róisín Elsafty and with tarantella specialist Lucilla Galeazzi. He has toured with Bobby McFerrin, interpreted the music of Steve Reich with the Bang on a Can All-Stars, and accompanied flamenco star Pepe Habichuela and Greek singer Savina Yannatou.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances']",

This is no lazy pastiche, no dressing up box. They live and breathe this music and want you to get immersed with them.The Tea Pad are ten years into a remarkable story that began with four friends studying at Newcastle University and now sees them playing venues and festivals across the UK and mainland Europe. Based in Newcastle Upon Tyne but with members hailing from Orkney to Warwickshire, the Tea Pad sound draws on myriad influences – from Hank Williams to Django Reinhardt, Tom Waits to The Beatles – yet ultimately sounds like nobody else, that North Eastern Swing style that’s utterly their own and changing all the time.Across their four studio albums – 2012’s “Money Isn’t Everything”, 2014’s “Talk About The Weather”, 2016’s “Something Blue” and 2019’s “Soul Of My City” – the band have constantly added new flavours to their sound: Heron in particular is a vinyl obsessive, always fired up about some new passion – calypso or boogaloo or whatever this week brings – and that eclecticism feeds into their songs, with the newest releases adding twangy 60s guitar tones and modernist R&B styles.The band tour the way bands should – widely and endlessly – winning friends and fans at each new show with notable performances at festivals like Glastonbury, Bestival, Wilderness and Cambridge Folk Festival. They’ve appeared three times on Radio 4’s Loose Ends, and had their music played by everyone from Marc Riley to Huey Morgan.October 2022 will see the band release their fifth studio album, “The Party’s Over”, which takes their signature blend of classic country and rhythm and blues to a new level. After a decade of honing their craft, this might be the best album to date!Joining Rob Heron (vocals/guitar) is Tom Cronin (mandolin/harmonica/guitar), Colin Nicholson (accordion/organ/piano) and Ted Harbot (double bass/electric bass) and Paul Archibald (drums)","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances']",

Shannon Lay’s new album is tender intensity, placeless and ethereal.  It exists in the chasms of the present -- a world populated by shadow selves, spiritual awakenings, déjà vu, and past lives.

“Something sleeps inside us,” Lay insists on the opening track, and that’s the guiding philosophy throughout. A winding, golden, delicate thread of intuition that explores the unknown, the possibility. Its title, Geist, the German word for spirit, is rife with an otherworldly presence, the suggestion of another. The promise that you are never alone.

Lay tracked vocals and guitar at Jarvis Tavinere of Woods’s studio, then sent the songs out to multi-instrumentalists Ben Boye (Bonnie Prince Billy, Ty Segall) in Los Angeles and Devin Hoff (Sharon Van Etten, Cibo Matto) in New York; trusting their musical instincts and intuition. She then sent those recordings to Sofia Arreguin (Wand) and Aaron Otheim (Heatwarmer, Mega Bog) for additional keys, while Ty Segall contributed a guitar solo on “Shores.”

As a whole, Geist is both esoteric and accessible. There’s the concise, pared-back cover of Syd Barrett’s tilt-a-whirl-esque “Late Night,” while ""Rare to Wake,” inspired by Dune, is existential and meditative, a circular guitar riff looping at the core of it.  “Awaken and Allow,” is ancient-feeling and mainly a cappella, its melody channels her deep Irish roots, a moment of reflection, before a drop happens -- its intensity mirroring the anticipation and anxiety that come with taking the first step to accepting change for yourself.

“Time’s Arrow,” with its refrain of heading downhill, was inspired by something a close friend said. Lay notes: “I wanted ‘Time’s Arrow’ to be this gentle reminder that we're on our way, and we're moving forward.  There is medicine in every moment so don’t rush.”

“Thread to Find,” which Lay wrote after walking into an old hotel in Switzerland and being struck by the feeling like she’d been there before, is a testament to the energy we leave behind and stumble across.

And the title track “Geist,” a song about the power living in all of us, is a love song to the possibility of healing, an ode to falling into the arms of what you’re becoming. It’s a glimpse into the parts of yourself you have yet to meet. But you can, if you want to.

In a different sense the video also functions to import external realities into the concert hall or performance scenario.Michael presents this lecture/workshop in an informal environment and relaxed style. The material presented is stimulating and challenging (in the good sense) and remains both approachable and for musicians, composers and concert-goers, and this workshop/lecture is suitable for anyone with an interest in contemporary music composition and/or mixed media composition.Please note the venue for this event is the Contemporary Music Centre, 18 Fishamble Street.Music Current workshops are supported by the Contemporary Music Centre, Dublin (www.cmc.ie).

He studied mathematics and music at Kassel and Art History and Philosophy at Hamburg. Since the early 90s he has written music organised using techniques other than pitch-based organisation.His composition method involves an extraordinarily wide range of techniques and practices, including: working with instruments, objects, preparations, applications, oscillating systems and motors, and exploring longitudinal wave phenomena on nylon strings, undertones on string instruments, friction on different structured surfaces, activation of instruments and objects by mechanical and sonic motors, plastic materials for constructing new resonance spaces and developing analogue vocoder for wind instruments and the voice.He has been a guest lecturer at Trinity College in Dublin, Stuttgarter Musikhochschule, California Institute of the Arts, Los Angeles, Mozarteum Salzburg and the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijng, China, the Musikhochschule Freiburg, Germany and in 2015 at the University of Cordoba, Argentina.Since 2004 he has been the cellist with the improv-trio NORDZUCKER (Hamburg/Berlin) and with the quartet ""Stark Bewölkt"".

Special guest on the night is electro-pop wunderkind Neosupervital. As a follow up to the first two singles released in late 2022 - Purple Heather and In the Garden - Go Gracefully is a contemplative offering, steeped in the singer songwriter tradition and featuring some of those unexpected lyrical detours for which M Stevens is known. Exploring themes such as Catholicism, alienation and spiritual paralysis, it opens with a simple, finger-picked guitar before working its way towards a grand emotional swell.Reviews for Birds“Birds is an exciting debut album that lives up to the experience and pedigree of the talent onboard … (a) blend of wit and thoughtfulness …. wonderfully produced and arranged” (The Goo November 2022)“Strings, flutes, mandolins and music hall piano are all employed to build deftly appointed musical worlds for Stevens to populate with drunk gods, alien ejaculate and UV lit teeth” (Totally Dublin January 2023)“ … oscillates between the delicate and driving while keeping the same mordant wit and tongue in its cheek … an earnest yet wry album that is made with such heart that it can’t help but charm” (The Thin Air, November 2022). Neosupervital (aka Tim O’Donovan) has released two albums to date - ‘Neosupervital’ (2006) and ‘Battery Power’ (2010). The third album, aptly titled ‘3’, arrives later this year. It features all the hallmark. Neosupervital synths, beats, lyrics and harmonies, whilst adding new spacious textures, wonky guitars and some more laid back rhythms.As well as fronting Neosupervital, Tim has drummed for Irish bands Bell X1, Join Me In The Pines and Keeley, and was one half of electro pop duo Buffalo Woman.‘Back to What’ (2023 Mix) is the latest NSV single. It's a 3:11 pop tune about getting back to the simpler things like walking, riding on a train, sitting on a step, and other important things of that nature.

After the band dissolved, producer Ronnie Stone (The Pixies, David Gray and Mansun) suggested Duncan as a replacement for the guitar player who had just left Irish band Picture House. By the end of 1993, Duncan was a full-time member and one of the band’s principal songwriters who was responsible for two of their biggest hits, Heavenly Day and Sunburst. 
After he departed the band Duncan began playing with acclaimed Irish band Pugwash and he also began recording his own material at home and enjoyed several successful solo gigs across the country. 2001 saw Duncan gigging solo and with Pugwash, as well as playing on their second album, the highly praised Almanac and he secured his first film soundtrack addition when Sunburst was featured in the comedy, The Most Fertile Man in Ireland.  In 2004 he commenced work with Pugwash on their third studio album, playing alongside XTC’s Dave Gregory and the Section Quartet at the infamous Abbey Road studios. He also found time to compose soundtrack music for the film Detained - which gathered great reviews for both film and music.
The beginning of 2005 saw Duncan returning to song writing, co-penning the song Anchor with XTC’s Andy Partridge and Pugwash’s Thomas Walsh in time for the completion of the Pugwash album, Jollity. Leading on from this involvement, Duncan was asked to contribute keyboards to the XTC song Say It for the band’s Apple Box release. He has also toured with Anny Celsi and Nelson Bragg, of the Brian Wilson Band and in 2010 recorded first solo album Lullabies For The 21st Century, to huge critical acclaim and it made many ‘best of’ end of year top tens. In the past decade he has been in demand as a producer and session musician, producing among others Slumberjet, Colin Hare, Gavin Mee and the new upcoming album by Jack Lukeman. 
Duncan is currently finishing his new album with Leslie Keye at Arad Studios and will be debuting new material alongside ‘golden oldies’ at The Wild Duck gig. “Folks can expect some new stuff being played for the very first time, some stuff from Lullabies for the 21st Century and maybe some bits from along the way...it's going to be a stripped back and intimate affair which is just the way we like it.”

This is a very special opportunity to get up close and personal with some of the innovators and legends of the jazz and blues scene in a setting that will provide a unique experience for the listener and performer alike.Following on from previous artists Larry Goldings, Jon Cleary, Trio Grande and Jo Lawry will be the amazing US jazz and soul singer Dana Masters.Dana was born and raised in the deep south of the United States by family who ushered in and were deeply involved with the Civil Rights Movement of the 50’s and 60’s. Granddaughter of a celebrated Civil Rights Activist, Dana believes deeply that music can tell human stories with such humility and honesty that it transcends divisions.In 2008 Dana married an Irishman, taking her from Los Angeles to Northern Ireland. It was here Dana began a long collaboration working with Van Morrison and was catapulted into the Jazz scene,  re-igniting her appetite for the expression, freedom and musicianship that jazz carried.Infused with the music she grew up on (soul, funk, r&b and gospel), Dana’s sound celebrates the roots, freedom and diversity of improvised music.Joining Dana will be the Cian Boylan piano trio featuring Darren Beckett on drums and Dave Redmond on double bass.“Dana’s wide-ranging musical influences are evident through her own unique sound. Her vocal dexterity spaces the spectrum from deeply meditative to soaring, soulful resonant highs“ Van Morrison“A jazz singer of real note… will long be remembered for the exceptional quality of her voice.“ ★★★★★ All About JazzTickets include a complimentary drinks reception before and after in the Dingle Distillery Bar located in Camden Recording Studios.Tickets are limited so book early to avoid disappointment.THURSDAY APR 6th 2023EARLY SHOW • 7pm   (Complimentary Bar from 6:30pm)LATER SHOW • 9pm   (Complimentary Bar from 8:30pm)","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#jazz', '#dublin', '#thingstodoindublin', '#jazzconcert', '#irelandevents', '#speakeasysessions', '#dublin_city_events', '#jazz_music', '#dublin_events', '#camdenrecordingstudios']",€50

Through ethereal soundscapes and introspective lyrics, the song encourages listeners to confront moments of personal turmoil and embrace the process of growth and self-awareness. With its haunting vocals and soaring guitar riffs, this song is an ode to resilience and growth in the face of personal struggles. INGOODFRM (pronounced. “in good form”) is a Dublin-based post-dream / shoegaze band formed by ex-members of the band 'Father!', which sadly faded away with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, out of the ashes of that band emerged a new group of musicians with a renewed sense of purpose and a determination to make their mark on the Dublin scene. INGOODFRM isn't just a band - it's a collective of architecture and design school graduates who bring a unique sense of creativity and visual artistry to their music. This is reflected not only in their sound, but also in their live performances, which often feature visual projections and audio sampling. At the core of INGOODFRM's sound is Seán Brunswick, who writes, records, and produces all the band's music. His influences include alex g, spirit of the beehive, bdrmm, cryogeyser and DIIV. INGOODFRM is slowly building a loyal following ahead of the release of their first single 'nosedive' mastered by Simon Scott (SPS Mastering / Slowdive)..  ‘nosedive’ will be available to stream across all platforms on 6th April 2023https://linktr.ee/ingoodfrm","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#concert', '#gigs', '#dublin', '#free_event', '#bedrooms', '#whelanslive', '#dublin_events', '#dublingigs', '#dublin_music_performances', '#ingoodfrm']",

In the years preceding 1816, the year in which The Coroner’s Daughter is set, forensic investigation into deaths was almost non-existent. 1816 was also the year of publication of George Male’s Epitome of Forensic Medicine, a pivotal guide as to how marks of a violent death appear on a body, and a textbook which became instrumental in The Coroner’s Daughter. This panel discussion will explore the history of forensic science, the development of investigative techniques, and their use in crime fiction, from the historical through to the contemporary.T﻿his event is part of One Dublin One Book 2023, where the chosen book is The Coroner's Daughter by Andrew Hughes, published by Transworld. One Dublin One Book is a Dublin City Council initiative, led by Dublin City Libraries, which encourages everyone to read a book connected with the capital city during the month of April every year. Supported by Dublin UNESCO City of Literature and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. *﻿**Andrew Hughes was born in Wexford and educated at Trinity College, Dublin.

It includes areas such as George’s Dock, Spencer Dock, the Royal Canal, Mayor Street, Guild Street, and Sheriff Street. It was once one of the bustling communities of Dublin’s old docklands where ships would arrive and unload goods; it is now an area of huge contrast, as modern developments grow amidst the remnants of the old port and dockland communities.The area gets its name from the wall that was constructed along the river Liffey just over 300 years ago to extend the docklands. This allowed former swampland between the river and the North Strand to be reclaimed and divided up into lots in 1717 which could be infilled by the new owners and creating the long standing community of the North Wall.Prepare yourself to be amazed by the rich history and culture of this part of Dublin Inner City!MEETING POINT: Connolly Station,  Dublin1 (Amiens Street entrance).","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Tours', 'Dublin Community Tours', '#dublinevents', '#walking_tour', '#dublin_city_events', '#dublinhistory', '#dublinport', '#dublin1', '#dublinheritage', '#discoverdublin', '#dublinamazing', '#dublinculture']",€11.70

It is a joint prize awarded in alternate years by the Royal Irish Academy in Ireland (funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs) and the Académie française in France. The winning author gets a prize of €10,000 and the honour of visiting the other country to deliver the Michel Déon Lecture the following year. The 2021 winner of the Académie française prize was Mr. François Cérésa. In this conversation with Professor Mary Gallagher, Mr. Céréza will explore not just the emphasis of his own oeuvre, but also his perspective and his experience as a writer. French writer and member of the Académie française, Chantal Thomas will introduce François Cérésa.François Cérésa is a French writer and journalist. He is the author of about forty books, exploring the more or less fertile lands of French literature for years. Free from any constraints of genre or style, Cérésa takes his reader on a journey through space and time. He goes from the historical novel, in the footsteps of Victor Hugo or Duma, to the more or less disguised autobiography, via parodic tales and even the most dishevelled picaresque epics.He is also a distinguished journalist, who has worked for the Nouvel Observateur, the Figaro, and Paris Match. In 2007, he founded Service littéraire, a monthly magazine dedicated to the defence and illustration of the French language through demanding criticism of current novels. The journal, which aims to be the Canard enchaîné of literary criticism, is distinguished by its freedom of tone and is written exclusively by writers.He has received twelve literary prizes including the Michel Déon Prize from the Académie française in 2021.Mary Gallagher is currently Professor of French and Francophone Studies at University College Dublin. Her principal contribution to this field is the study of how (mass) mental domination, betrayal and trauma register in 20th- and 21st-century writing in French. She has published studies on the writings of Saint-John Perse, Edouard Glissant, Emmanuel Levinas, Colette Fellous, Annie Ernaux, Paul Morand, Dany Laferrière, Edwidge Danticat, Emile Ollivier and Paul Léon, amongst others.

It is also regarded as being one of the worst Famines in history (deaths as a proportion to population). The use of the word 'Famine' in this context is controversial, for Ireland at the time was part of the richest Empire in the World (the British Empire). There was sufficient food in the country throughout the 'Famine' years, yet over a million people died from starvation and disease, and millions more were forced to flee. 


Some historians prefer to use the name 'Great Hunger' to describe this event.


Our exhibition is a temporary mobile museum / exhibition. 


This Exhibition tells the story of what happened during those horrific years. We use rare 19th century photographs, witness accounts, contemporary sketches as well as maps and statistical information. Also on display are two original Newspapers, two personal letters and a Famine Soup Pot. A 15 minute film with seating is included in the Exhibition and the average time spent by visitors is 1 and 1/4 hours.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Other', 'Dublin Community Other', '#museum', '#irish', '#famine', '#evictions', '#emigration', '#irishculture', '#workhouses']",€8 – €30

Part memoir, part history and part polemic, How to Fix Northern Ireland shows how the split between catholics and protestants infests everyday life - from education and segregated housing, from street protests, bonfires and parades to the high politics of power sharing and Brexit - and asks what can be done to solve a centuries-old social rift and heal the relationship at the heart of the problem.","['United Kingdom Events', 'Belfast Events', 'Things to do in Belfast', 'Belfast Appearances', 'Belfast Community Appearances', '#booklaunch', '#howtofixnorthernitreland', '#malachiodoherty']",

 prisoners telling their story of the past decades whilst guiding visitors through the republican areas of West
 Belfast and then, at the famous gates of the Peace Wall, handing over the visitors to former loyalists activists
 to hear their narratives of their localities. This gives a unique first hand narrative of experiences across
 Belfast communities.
This three hours tour allows visitors to explore both the nationalist Falls Road and the unionist Shankill Road
 areas of Belfast. On the nationalist leg of the tour, the visitor will see the world famous International Wall with
 its political artworks, the Republican Memorial Garden and the world famous mural of Bobby Sands. This tour tracks the course of the “Peace Wall” and goes through Clonard with its famous Clonard Monastery
 Church and Bombay Street, the epicentre of events in 1969. The group will be then handed over to the
 loyalist tour guide who will bring it on to the Shankill Area, to hear the unionist/loyalist perspective on our
 past and visit local sites of interest.
This 3 hours walking tour starts at the Coiste’s mural at Divis Tower (Divis Street) and finishes on the Lower

They want to turn the clock back on the progressive change that has been driven by young people from below.The actions of far-right organisers on social media and on the streets have real consequences. People of colour, migrants, refugees and LGBTQIA people have been threatened and have been attacked. This Government is shifting further to the right in its rhetoric and is also imposing harsher treatment of refugees, along with the EU.We need to act urgently to stop the development of a fascist movement here. They create scapegoats to blame for the conditions that flow from the crisis in the capitalist system in many countries. They support the brutal and unjust capitalist system. They support landlords over tenants; bosses over workers; and warmongers over refugees.

Mark O Hara of the Alliance stated, I came across Philip at a talk hosted by Sean McCafferty, another Alliance member at the Fit House recently. I was very impressed by what I was hearing from Philip. Philip brought the latest science, learning on personal development and philosophy to the conversation on wellbeing. In a very natural and engaging way Philip is able to create a space for people to share their experiences and learn from each other. I immediately knew I wanted to invite Philip to meet our coaches in the North Belfast Sports and Well-being Alliance and was delighted that Philip offered to deliver a free workshop for us, without even being asked. That in itself demonstrates Philips drive to be a part of positive community health change. 

At the event on April 5th, Philip, who has supported leaders at the highest level in financial and technology institutions globally, will deliver a 90 minute Mind-Set and Performance workshop on how to lead yourself and others through change; create confidence; and equip sports coaches and athletes to support wellbeing in their clubs and community. 

Alliance founding member Matthew Caddel stated that the aim of the Alliance is to embed wellbeing into the agenda of local clubs, provide access to mental wellbeing training and connect people to services. Matthew commented that the event would be a great opportunity for members and non-members with an interest in individual and club wellbeing to hear from one of the leading speakers on mindset and performance on our own doorstep.

The free workshop that is co-hosted by TAMHI is at 7pm on 5 April, 2023 at Girdwood Centre, Belfast. Anyone interested in attending can register for the event at Eventbrite at (link). For further details contact TAMHI at Kevin@tamhi.org

Fantastic Bugs and Wonderful Worms: Want to help our planet spin with bug-packed, plant phizzy and worm wiggly friends?  Get ready for a wild adventure: worm searches and bug identification. A hands-on session: Your challenge will be to make amazing homes and mini-gardens for your new wild creature friends to live in – and there will be fascinating natural building materials for you to experiment with.

The Secret Garden – Discover nature on a nature spotting expedition–  you will start your journey with a lucky nature dip of clues, armed with bug and plant identification kits, to find your way around the garden to solve a Nature mystery.  You will have 60 minutes to search for hidden natural objects dotted around the garden. At the end of the hunt, there will be a reward for whoever finds the strangest garden treasures!

A great way to discover what is going on in the seasons – and stir naturally, the amazing artist in you!

Enter a magic carpet ride –get into the groove with the rhythm and twists of Nature!

Seed Bombs: Make a dazzling nature blast – collect your favourite flower seeds, create colourful bombs to shower new colours into nature.

Throughout this workshop we will also cover safety tips, a dog’s needs, and a fun little quiz on Dogs Trust and our history.
Once the workshop is done, we will then embark on an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour of our kennels, and you will see many of the dogs who are currently journeying towards their forever home.
The workshop is pitched for children aged 7-12 and their families, and tickets cost €5.

This film is part of the 'Measurement, modernism and mystics' screening programme, curated by film curator Alice Butler. The film will be introduced by Alice, who will also moderate a post-screening discussion. A﻿ll welcome.Free, book here or come on the day subject to availability.Background: Beyond Yeats’ popular profile and his cultural tourist caché, little is really known of his complex life story – his tricky love-life, his deep and abiding obsession with the occult and the spirit world, his respectable and not-so-respectable political leanings. And few public figures have articulated their inner and outer life so completely, so fully, as WB Yeats did in his writing. Despite his position as our unofficial “national’ poet, there is much about WB Yeats that is both fascinating and unknown to the general public – his difficult childhood, his complicated and passionate love life, his enduring interest and belief in the occult, his active political involvements, his flirtation with fascism. His life – alongside his sublime poetry and prose – is a wonderfully dramatic and engaging narrative. It is a life that mirrored its time and the birth of the nation, a nation which was arguably forged as much in Yeats’ imagination as on the streets. The narrative spine of this film-poem has been edited from the extensive writings of Yeats - drawn from his memoirs, letters, speeches prose, and, of course, his poems – and then recorded by acclaimed actor Brendan Coyle. This forms the structural bed for the visual material, filmed personally by the director Alan Gilsenan and edited in close creative collaboration with multiple IFTA award-winning editor Emer Reynolds. In conjunction with the National Library of Ireland (with whom the company made a number of short films for the NLI’s Yeats Exhibition), Yellow Asylum also uncovered a wide range of unseen film footage and photographs specially seen in this film. These include:•	Newly discovered footage of WB Yeats relaxing and smoking with his wife George and friends by the sea in Malta (the only other moving footage of Yeats is a few moments after receiving his Nobel Prize in Stockholm).•	Extensive unseen 16mm black and white footage of his body being brought home to Sligo from the South of France by the Irish navy. •	Very moving home-movie Super 8mm footage of his remains being re-interred in Drumcliffe Cemetery in the shadow of Ben Bulben.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Screenings', 'Dublin Film & Media Screenings', '#wbyeats', '#poetrydayireland', '#hughlanefilm']",

Din toată această poveste, Dima învață un lucru important –„să fie Om!”, iar această descoperire îi schimbă viața!Mai multe detalii despre echipa de creație a filmului puteți găsi aici: http://carbonfilm.md/❗ATENȚIE: Cinematograful este închiriat pe ore.

Schirmer with guest speaker Dr Hilary Lennon. Join us in Hodges Figgis at 6PM on Wednesday 12 April.A﻿ll welcome. Book your free spot before 11 April via Eventbrite.A﻿BOUT THE BOOKWhile Frank O’Connor was known primarily as one of Ireland’s finest short-story writers, he was also an accomplished translator. In the long line of Irish writers given to translating poems in Irish into poems written in English – a tradition stretching back at least as far as Jonathan Swift – he stands out above all the rest.Between the mid-1920s and the mid-1960s, O’Connor published 121 translations that give voice to the full range of this centuries-old tradition. Collected here in full for the first time, O’Connor’s work shows an uncanny aptitude for carrying over into English verse many of the riches to be found in the originals – the ancient voice of the Hag of Beare lamenting her decline into old age; the voices of the early monks describing the Irish landscape, Irish weather, their religious faith, and, in at least one instance, their cat; the voice of Hugh O’Rourke’s wife torn between loyalty to her husband and a rising desire for her seducer. All these voices haunted O’Connor throughout his career, whatever else he was doing. The collection includes the Irish-language sources for all 121 translations along with literal translations, enabling the reader to see what O’Connor started from.O’Connor’s translations sprang from a compulsive desire to breathe life into Ireland’s past, to ‘look back to look forward,’ as he once put it; for him the Irish-language tradition was not for scholars and archives alone, but formed a living body of work vitally relevant to an Ireland that seemed puzzlingly indifferent to it.Thanks to O’Connor’s profound love of his country’s language and its rich, literary subsoil – ‘a literature of which no Irishman need feel ashamed’, he once said – these voices from Ireland’s past can still be heard. Strikingly modern in tone, they conjoin flesh and spirit, the sacred and the secular, in a way that speaks to humankind.ABOUT THE AUTHORFrank O’Connor (1903–66) was an Irish writer of extraordinary versatility and fecundity, best known for his short stories and memoirs. The Frank O’Connor International Short Story Award is named in his honour.Born and raised in Cork, in 1918 O’Connor joined the First Brigade of the Irish Republican Army and served in combat during the Irish War of Independence. He was befriended by George William Russell (Æ), Yeats, Lennox Robinson, F. R. Higgins and Augusta Gregory, and from 1937 to 1939 became managing director of the Abbey Theatre. In 1950, he accepted invitations to teach at Stanford and Harvard in the United States of America, where his short stories were published to acclaim in The New Yorker.ABOUT THE EDITORGregory A. Schirmer has written books on Austin Clarke and William Trevor, and Out of What Began: A History of Irish Poetry in English (Cornell University Press, 1998). He edited After the Irish: An Anthology of Poetic Translation (Cork University Press, 2009) and is author of The Midnight Court: Eleven Versions of Merriman (Lilliput Press, 2015). He lives in west Cork with his wife, the fiction writer Jane Mullen.PRAISE  FOR ‘LOOK BACK TO LOOK FORWARD’‘Frank O’Connor was the king, the lords and the commons of Irish translators. His passionate love of Irish literature and tradition is captured here in his life-long endeavour to make that tradition available in English. This wonderful collection is a tribute to his skill in transmitting poetry from the earliest period into modernity. It is the best we have.’ Alan Titley, Emeritus Professor of Modern Irish UCC‘Look Back to Look Forward’: Frank O’Connor’s Complete Translations from the Irish is available to pre-order now.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Appearances', 'Dublin Hobbies Appearances', '#poetry', '#books', '#bookstore', '#booksigning', '#translation', '#booklaunch', '#booktalk', '#book_discussion', '#dublin_events', '#things_to_do_in_dublin']",

Donegal. Suitable for all skill levels, this experience is a fantastic introduction to both cable knitting techniques and traditional Irish design.

Aran cable knitting originated off the west coast of Ireland within the boundaries of its namesake home, the Aran Islands – a neat group of Gaeltacht isles nestled in the cold, restless waters of the Atlantic; their history long, rich and holding tight to an Irish-speaking status to this day. It is here that the ‘Aran Jumper’ hails from, this notable knitwear incorporating the very techniques this course will pass on to you.
Aran hand-knitting has unfortunately fared less well in this modern world, seeing a decline that demands attention. In the spirit of preserving and promoting a niche piece of Irish heritage, this experience aims to share this longstanding hand-knitting technique; sourcing Irish wool produced in co. Donegal to serve as our core material, encouraging not only the cultural aspect of Aran knitting, but happily supporting the economy surrounding it.

Equipment
All materials are included:
• Knitting needles
• Irish wool yarn in traditional báinín white
• Aran scarf knitting pattern

We will spend some time foraging together and discussing edibility and uses. There will be opportunities to smell, feel and taste wild foods fresh from the ground. This workshop is geared towards adults who are new to foraging and is limited to 10 places. This is an outdoor event so please come prepared in case of wet weather. The walk is somewhat strenuous and will involve some physical activity such as bending. About meI'm Alex, I live in County Wicklow. I am a graduate ecologist and a keen forager. I'm most content when sitting amongst trees and listening to the hustle and bustle of the forest. I love to explore the plentiful gifts of nature and share my passion and knowledge with others.I have been raised by avid wild food foragers and was trained to scout for mushrooms from a very young age. I am not a mushroom expert however I have safely foraged for and consumed many types of wild mushrooms. I can help you get started on your journey and give you confidence to identify edible species of the forest. I am passionate about learning and teaching and like to think that my enthusiasm and passion are infectious.  About Understory Understory is where passion for sustainable and eco-craft meets environmental education and community empowerment. We operate largely on principles of honesty, equality, sharing knowledge and helping each other to thrive and make positive change in the world.__________________________________________________________Follow our journey on:www. understory.iewwww.instagram.com/understory_ie/https://www.facebook.com/understory.ie","['Ireland Events', 'Wicklow Events', 'Things to do in Wicklow', 'Wicklow Classes', 'Wicklow Hobbies Classes', '#nature', '#foraging', '#forest', '#wildfood', '#sustainable_living', '#foraging_walk', '#edible_plants', '#nature_discovery']",

Writing short stories for magazines?Start with nothing and watch your words flow.Let Nicola Kearns, an International and Best-selling Author & Creative Writing coach, show you how to get that story finished and printed, in a magazine, or even begin the first chapter of your own novel. Our Creative Writing Workshop is for people who have not written since they left school, or for experienced writers - who need to feel inspired again or wish to write something completely different than their usual genre, for example going from fiction writing, to poetry or writing their memoirs. Creative writing is all about getting the ideas in your head down on paper, simply getting your thoughts out. If you leave the course with one word on paper, that is okay. If you leave with a notebook full of writing, that is okay.  Writing can be emotional. It is hard enough to put our thoughts into words at times, never mind write them down.  We all have a unique story, whether it is fictional or factual. What is Creative Writing?Creative writing is anything where the purpose is to express thoughts, feelings and emotions rather than to simply convey information. Types of creative writing include: •	Poetry. •	Plays. •	Movie and television scripts. •	Fiction (novels, novellas, and short stories) •	Songs. •	Speeches. •	Memoirs. •	Personal essays. Your spelling ability does not matter here. All that matters is your will to write - be inspired, fire your imagination, and to work through the process of composing your work in manageable stages under Nicola’s experienced guidance.The words you write while you are here, nobody has ever written before. That is creative writing. It could be the beginning of a whole new chapter in your own life.Please note the 'Deposit and Missed Classes Refund Policy' belowBelow is a review of Nicola's coaching skills from Leitrim writer Seamus O'RourkeSome reviews and comments from students that have attended Nicola's Creative Writing Workshops here at LSA"" I absolutely loved doing the course and you're style of tutoring was so encouraging and genuine. You yourself created such a sense of ease and fun in the class, which helped everyone feel safe and shine.""""I am absolutely overwhelmed by your generosity regarding my writing. Thank you. I enjoyed your coaching so much, and have learned so much in 5 short weeks. I feel I've got the writing bug now, and have been writing every day. I am so glad our paths crossed, and I do hope I get to work with you again, in the near future. Thank you again. With warm regards always""""It has been fantastic. I have done other creative writing courses but now I finally have an idea of where I can go with what has been on my mind for years and how to do it. Thank you Nicola."""" I feel like you opened me up to the belief that I can write. I am so blessed to have found your course, the way you teach is just made for the people who have lost faith in themselves and need a hand to guide them back. I don't know how to thank you enough. All I can say is I hope I make you proud because you have put me back on the pathxxxx.""Leitrim School of Art (LSA)Deposit and Missed Classes Refund Policy from 1st December 2022(a)	Due to substantial increases in business costs LSA cannot offer discounts, refunds, or alternative places on future events for missed classes within class blocks.(b)	A request for a refund of a deposit may be considered if the refund request is received by LSA at least 10 days before the start of the event.(c)	A request to transfer a deposit to another event may be considered if the request to transfer is received by LSA at least 10 days before the start of the originally booked event.(d)	Requests for refunds or transfer of deposits must be notified to LSA by email to michael@leitrimartschool.ie(e)	Requests for refunds will be responded to by LSA within 3 days of the request being notified to us.(f)	Your statutory rights as a consumer are not affected and LSA will “make good” on its obligations to consumers for failure to provide classes and workshops (e.g., event cancellation).",[],

Writing short stories for magazines?Start with nothing and watch your words flow.Let Nicola Kearns, an International and Best-selling Author & Creative Writing coach, show you how to get that story finished and printed, in a magazine, or even begin the first chapter of your own novel. Our Creative Writing Workshop is for people who have not written since they left school, or for experienced writers - who need to feel inspired again or wish to write something completely different than their usual genre, for example going from fiction writing, to poetry or writing their memoirs. Creative writing is all about getting the ideas in your head down on paper, simply getting your thoughts out. If you leave the course with one word on paper, that is okay. If you leave with a notebook full of writing, that is okay.  Writing can be emotional. It is hard enough to put our thoughts into words at times, never mind write them down.  We all have a unique story, whether it is fictional or factual. What is Creative Writing?Creative writing is anything where the purpose is to express thoughts, feelings and emotions rather than to simply convey information. Types of creative writing include: •	Poetry. •	Plays. •	Movie and television scripts. •	Fiction (novels, novellas, and short stories) •	Songs. •	Speeches. •	Memoirs. •	Personal essays. Your spelling ability does not matter here. All that matters is your will to write - be inspired, fire your imagination, and to work through the process of composing your work in manageable stages under Nicola’s experienced guidance.The words you write while you are here, nobody has ever written before. That is creative writing. It could be the beginning of a whole new chapter in your own life.Please note the 'Deposit and Missed Classes Refund Policy' belowBelow is a review of Nicola's coaching skills from Leitrim writer Seamus O'RourkeSome reviews and comments from students that have attended Nicola's Creative Writing Workshops here at LSA"" I absolutely loved doing the course and you're style of tutoring was so encouraging and genuine. You yourself created such a sense of ease and fun in the class, which helped everyone feel safe and shine.""""I am absolutely overwhelmed by your generosity regarding my writing. Thank you. I enjoyed your coaching so much, and have learned so much in 5 short weeks. I feel I've got the writing bug now, and have been writing every day. I am so glad our paths crossed, and I do hope I get to work with you again, in the near future. Thank you again. With warm regards always""""It has been fantastic. I have done other creative writing courses but now I finally have an idea of where I can go with what has been on my mind for years and how to do it. Thank you Nicola.""""

Nowhere’s Far – New & Selected Poems was published by Salt in 2008. Recent work includes ‘Orange Blind’, poems about the Scottish Colourists.Rhyme can make sense out of nonsense but when done badly rhymes are predictable and soggy. Phil’s workwhop will use examples from poets that include Philip Larkin, Adrian Mitchell, Robert Frost and Leonard Cohen – and work with rhyme in a way that lightens a complex thought rather than weighs one down. Dr DeAnn Bell is an author and lecturer who loves to teach old dogs new tricks. She is published with Women’s Archive Wales, Witches and Pagans, and Sage Woman and is a professional member of the National Association of Writers in Education, The Society of Authors, and organises the North Wales Pagan Moot Group. Writing in a trope-heavy genre such as supernatural fiction or the occult can be a minefield of reader expectations and unspoken genre rules. DeAnn’s workshop ‘Vampires that don’t bite’ will use tried and true horror clichés to help you create stories that give old monsters new life.Emma Venables’ short and flash fiction has been widely published in magazines and journals. Her short story, ‘Woman at Gunpoint, 1945’ was a runner-up in the Alpine Fellowship Writing Prize 2020.

Her first novel, Fragments of a Woman, will be published by Aderyn Press in 2023. @EmmaMVenables. Emma’s workshop will focus on character & place in short fiction. We’ll examine how curiosity and empathy in the creative process lead to the development of authentic characters and environments. We’ll explore how to achieve this authenticity without overloading your narrative. Pauline Kenyon is a published author of 16 books.

She runs a weekly creativity clinic, writer’s groups and creativity retreats using such diverse methods as play, crafts, yoga, music, drumming, Hakomi, focusing, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnosis.Kat’s workshop distills observations and experience about the psychology behind creative blocks, with mindful and intuitive approaches to working through our blocks, unlocking our creative side, and enabling us to craft a better relationship with the inner critic that holds us back from our full potential as writers.Karen Ankers is a poet, playwright and novelist completing her PhD in creative writing. Her poetry has been published in a wide range of magazines and anthologies, and her short plays have been performed in the UK, USA, Australia, Malaysia and Canada. Her first novel, The Crossing Place, has been described by readers as ‘gripping’ and ‘compelling’. ‘Perspectives and Pace in Fiction’ will approach ‘seeing differently’, examining how adopting an altered perspective might impact on pace and plot development. As we follow characters around with a movie camera, sometimes long shots, sometimes close-ups, we’ll think about how different ways of seeing details can alter the mood of a scene, and how a slight shift in perspective can powerfully impact a reader’s experience.Glyn Edwards is a PhD researcher in eco-poetry at Bangor University. His first poetry collection, Vertebrae, is published by the Lonely Press. ‘In Orbit’ is forthcoming with Seren. Glyn edits the Wild Words feature for the North Wales Wildlife Trust and is Associate Editor at Modron magazine.

In association with Irish Academic Press.,"Starts on Wed, 5 Apr 2023 17:30 BST",No Alibis Bookstore 83 Botanic Avenue Belfast BT7 1JL United Kingdom,"Ties That Bind? is an engrossing and timely study of the historical, cultural and political relationship between Scotland and Northern Ireland at a seminal moment in the constitutional history of both places. It has seldom been acknowledged, and rarely explored in any real depth, but this important book conclusively demonstrates just how deeply entwined the two countries are.The book explores how Scottish-Ulster ties historically acted as a bridge between Britain and Ireland and should be central to contemporary debates regarding Britishness, sectarianism and devolution. It reveals the connections and tensions between ascendent Scottish nationalism, Brexit, and deadlock in Northern Ireland, and argues that, rather than the inevitable collapse of the UK, these challenges show that the constitutional futures of Scotland and Northern Ireland are both still very much up for grabs.Graham Walker is Emeritus Professor of Political History at Queen's University Belfast. He has published widely in the subject areas of Irish and Scottish history and politics, and the politics of sport.Dr James Greer's publications have focused on the political history of Ulster unionism, the modern Troubles, British and Irish labour, and Irish Presbyterianism. His research has also explored the politics of European integration in Northern Ireland, and literature and popular culture in twentieth-century Northern Ireland.Guest speaker Richard English is Professor of Politics at Queen's University Belfast, where he is also Director of  the  Senator George J.

With An Artist’s Eye features a representative sample of 100 photographs taken from Mary Alice Young’s photographic collection which has been held at PRONI since 1975. Her images were safely stored at PRONI for over 45 years until they were rediscovered by Mary Alice’s great-grandson, Christopher Brooke. Mary Alice Young began taking photographs in 1890, and over a 20-year period, she captured snapshots of her family in Galgorm Castle, her travels around Ireland and rural life in Ballymena. As seen on the BBC NI programme, The Lost Photographs of Mary Alice Young, thanks to the work of PRONI staff in restoring, digitising and cataloguing the negatives, over 1,100 of Mary Alice’s photographs have been made available to the public for the first time.Join PRONI staff members Lorraine Bourke (Private Records), Sarah Graham (Head of Conservation) and Joy Carey (Digitisation and Reprographics Manager) to hear about the rewarding process of bringing Mary Alice Young’s photography collection back to life and transforming it into a digitally available resource for the public to enjoy.Lorraine Bourke has been in post as Head of Private Records at PRONI for over 8 years.  Together with her team, Lorraine is responsible for meeting potential depositors and appraising archival material, cataloguing privately deposited collections and facilitating access to them. Meeting the people who have created records or looked after them over the years and learning more from them about these documents is the highlight of her job. Sarah Graham has been Head of Conservation at PRONI since 2019, having previously worked at the National Archives of Ireland, London Metropolitan Archives, and Special Collections and Archives in Glasgow and Maynooth Universities. Sarah has joint honours in History and History of Art as an undergraduate before moving to Lincoln University for her GDip and MA in interventive conservation. She is accredited as a Book and a Paper Conservator by the Institute of Conservator-Restorers, Ireland. Sarah is UK and Ireland representative for the European Centre for Book and Paper Conservation-Restoration and Joint Training Officer for the Preservation and Conservation Group of the Archive Records Association.Joy Carey has been in post as Digitisation and Reprographics Unit Manager at PRONI for twelve years. Joy studied Art History at the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1998, before taking up various roles in the GLAM sector, notably Electronic Services Development Officer for the National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh, before joining PRONI in 2009.

Not content with a sold out tour of Ireland and the regions, Damien also played to a full house (and square) at London’s Electric Ballroom and the St Patricks Day Celebrations in Trafalgar Square. He will end the year with a run of shows and 5 sold out nights at Vicar Street in Dublin.The release of ‘Love Yourself Today’ gave an insight into his legendary Vicar Street Christmas shows but also the incredible bond he has with his fans and the undoubted healing power of his music. Following a number of individuals who have been strongly influenced by his message, beautifully shot new documentary ‘Love Yourself Today’ unearths their stories of overcoming pain and finding solace in his music. The film successfully explains the Dublin singer-songwriter’s appeal by focusing on what his songs mean to fans.“Singing and music are two of the few spiritual entities in the physical world, so we need to harness them and get people immersed in them,"" Dempsey explains, ""because when people lose themselves at a gig, when everyone sings together, they carry a vibration away from the gig that spreads out like a ripple into others, it’s a way of healing.""Damien Dempsey’s importance as a singer and songwriter of great passion, conviction and beauty has never been more prominent. He is that rare gem of an artist, an ex boxer – with the soul of a poet, whose heroes and influences are as diverse as Christy Moore, Shane McGowan, Luke Kelly and Bob Marley. With themes of addiction, loss but also hope and positivity, Dempsey’s music often reflects his fans' pain, alleviates their anguish and ultimately provides peace as they ‘sing all their cares away’.","['Ireland Events', 'Meath Events', 'Things to do in Dunboyne', 'Dunboyne Performances', 'Dunboyne Music Performances', '#damiendempsey', '#dunboynecastle']",

It is the culmination of a long tradition of Russian church music, and in particular the development of ‘choral orchestration’, summoning an enormous range of colour from the choir, and demanding virtuosity from all voices.Rachmaninov's All Night Vigil is truly a masterpiece, from a composer at the peak of his creative powers. Though it went largely unheard until the 1960s due to Bolshevik suppression of religious music, it has since earned its rightful place in the repertory, next to his symphonies, concertos and piano works.A﻿lso coming to Belfast on Friday 31st March.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#choir', '#choral', '#rachmaninoff', '#rachmaninov', '#classical_music', '#romantic_music']",€5 – €20

He was only 35. Though completed by others in his circle, and as with the Mass in C Minor, which he had mostly written by the mid 1780s, Mozart captures the drama and visceral emotion of the liturgy. Though much scholarly debate continues as to who completed the pieces, there is no escaping the magnificence and virtuosic demands of both, such that generations of artists have been inspired by these great masterpieces ever since.

Fringe Lab, Sycamore Building, Sycamore Street, Temple Bar, Dublin 2 on Friday evenings from 7:30 pm until 9:00 pm

With Sahaja Yoga Meditation, we usually sit on chairs to achieve yoga effortlessly & spontaneously. So there is no need for mats or special clothing.

All across the globe, many are seeking new sources of energy. Meanwhile, the most transformative energy is hiding in plain sight within us, and it's natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable.

It's called inner kundalini energy. And everyone already has it — everyone!. It is often likened to an inner feminine or motherly energy which automatically knows about us and what is needed to help us restore balance and harmony within our subtle being. It works spontaneously, effortlessly, organically, and cannot be paid for.

Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple, time-honoured technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself — emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually.

If you're having trouble juggling the challenges in your life, Sahaja Yoga Meditation might help you manage stress, master your emotions and find solutions to your problems. You may enjoy better health, better focus, and a deeper understanding of the universe and your place in it.

Meditation is not just for mystics and monks. Sahaja Yoga meditation is for everyone. Anyone can do it. It's that easy. But with the Sahaja Yoga experience, you'll quickly realise it isn't your typical Meditation. It's much more than just feeling peaceful and relaxed. Sahaja Yoga Meditation has many layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your way. Our volunteer experts are always available to help.

Ready to plug into your inner energy? A few minutes of your life may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy and light the path to lifelong transformation. It's all about energy — guaranteed pure and carbon neutral, and you can never have too much of it.

The best part? All classes are free. No strings, no catch.

Everyone is welcome. Bring a friend, bring yourself — all are welcome.Our website: www.freemeditation.ie","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Classes', 'Dublin Health Classes', '#free', '#meditation', '#free_event', '#meditation_workshop', '#meditation_for_beginners', '#meditation_class', '#sahaja_yoga']",Free

In the years preceding 1816, the year in which The Coroner’s Daughter is set, forensic investigation into deaths was almost non-existent. 1816 was also the year of publication of George Male’s Epitome of Forensic Medicine, a pivotal guide as to how marks of a violent death appear on a body, and a textbook which became instrumental in The Coroner’s Daughter. This panel discussion will explore the history of forensic science, the development of investigative techniques, and their use in crime fiction, from the historical through to the contemporary.T﻿his event is part of One Dublin One Book 2023, where the chosen book is The Coroner's Daughter by Andrew Hughes, published by Transworld. One Dublin One Book is a Dublin City Council initiative, led by Dublin City Libraries, which encourages everyone to read a book connected with the capital city during the month of April every year. Supported by Dublin UNESCO City of Literature and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. *﻿**Andrew Hughes was born in Wexford and educated at Trinity College, Dublin.

His debut novel, The Convictions of John Delahunt, was shortlisted for the Bord Gáis Irish Crime Book of the Year. The Coroner’s Daughter, a tale of a young lady sleuth operating at the dawn of forensic science, was nominated for the CWA Historical Dagger.

The set on theupcoming dates will draw from all their albums and include unreleased newmaterial.In recent years the Young Dubs have appeared twice on ABC’s Jimmy KimmelLive, had songs featured in TV shows (Sons Of Anarchy, Human Target) andtoured extensively as a headliner and as the opener for such a diverse list ofartists as Collective Soul, Jethro Tull, Johnny Lang, Los Lobos, Chris Isaak andmany more.Although the Young Dubliners sound is most commonly called ‘Celtic Rock’,that label can often be misleading. The Irish influence is certainly there, butit’s not the only influence that bursts through on their albums or live shows.After all, several of the band members have no Irish roots of any kind. “Thatwas always the idea”, explains Roberts “The sound was intended to be ahybrid because we all come from different backgrounds. Even though I amfrom Ireland, a lot of the music I listened to growing up wasn’t Irish at all, butwhen I got here, I got homesick and developed a new appreciation forIrish Music. In truth the Celtic riffs can just as easily come from the Americanband members. Everyone writes now so you never know what you’ll end upwith”“Their sound defies categorization. The Young Dubliners can be seen asIreland's answer to Los Lobos, with a similar combination of traditional folkmusic, raucous electric rock, and forward-thinking experimentation.”Allmusic.com""(the songs) range from stadium-friendly extravaganzas to more intimate butequally outspoken pub-sized opuses.Lead singer Keith Roberts' powerhouse vocals front a maelstrom of fiddlevamps, howling guitars and frenzied drums.

It takes place just after the beginning of the Covid lockdown, and is about a man who makes the irrational decision to come to Dublin to look for his son, who he has not seen in four years. His search takes him on an odyssey through inner city Dublin, and small acts of kindness light up his search as he hopes against hope to find his son in the deserted city. The story is a gentle hymn to the inner city. As in all of Roddy Doyle’s writing about Dublin, his stories explore the humour and emotions of people on the edge, and “The Five Lamps” becomes a truly life-affirming story.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Arts Performances', '#theatre', '#dublin', '#community_event', '#dublin_city_events', '#dublin_events', '#theatre_play', '#theatre_performance', '#theatre_production']",From €11.70

It was once one of the bustling communities of Dublin’s old docklands where ships would arrive and unload goods; it is now an area of huge contrast, as modern developments grow amidst the remnants of the old port and dockland communities.The area gets its name from the wall that was constructed along the river Liffey just over 300 years ago to extend the docklands. This allowed former swampland between the river and the North Strand to be reclaimed and divided up into lots in 1717 which could be infilled by the new owners and creating the long standing community of the North Wall.Prepare yourself to be amazed by the rich history and culture of this part of Dublin Inner City!MEETING POINT: Connolly Station,  Dublin1 (Amiens Street entrance).","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Tours', 'Dublin Community Tours', '#dublinevents', '#walking_tour', '#dublin_city_events', '#dublinhistory', '#dublinport', '#dublin1', '#dublinheritage', '#discoverdublin', '#dublinamazing', '#dublinculture']",€11.70

This film is part of the 'Measurement, modernism and mystics' screening programme, curated by film curator Alice Butler. The film will be introduced by Alice, who will also moderate a post-screening discussion. A﻿ll welcome.Free, book here or come on the day subject to availability.Background: Beyond Yeats’ popular profile and his cultural tourist caché, little is really known of his complex life story – his tricky love-life, his deep and abiding obsession with the occult and the spirit world, his respectable and not-so-respectable political leanings. And few public figures have articulated their inner and outer life so completely, so fully, as WB Yeats did in his writing. Despite his position as our unofficial “national’ poet, there is much about WB Yeats that is both fascinating and unknown to the general public – his difficult childhood, his complicated and passionate love life, his enduring interest and belief in the occult, his active political involvements, his flirtation with fascism. His life – alongside his sublime poetry and prose – is a wonderfully dramatic and engaging narrative. It is a life that mirrored its time and the birth of the nation, a nation which was arguably forged as much in Yeats’ imagination as on the streets. The narrative spine of this film-poem has been edited from the extensive writings of Yeats - drawn from his memoirs, letters, speeches prose, and, of course, his poems – and then recorded by acclaimed actor Brendan Coyle. This forms the structural bed for the visual material, filmed personally by the director Alan Gilsenan and edited in close creative collaboration with multiple IFTA award-winning editor Emer Reynolds. In conjunction with the National Library of Ireland (with whom the company made a number of short films for the NLI’s Yeats Exhibition), Yellow Asylum also uncovered a wide range of unseen film footage and photographs specially seen in this film. These include:•	Newly discovered footage of WB Yeats relaxing and smoking with his wife George and friends by the sea in Malta (the only other moving footage of Yeats is a few moments after receiving his Nobel Prize in Stockholm).•	Extensive unseen 16mm black and white footage of his body being brought home to Sligo from the South of France by the Irish navy. •	Very moving home-movie Super 8mm footage of his remains being re-interred in Drumcliffe Cemetery in the shadow of Ben Bulben.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Screenings', 'Dublin Film & Media Screenings', '#wbyeats', '#poetrydayireland', '#hughlanefilm']",

Over the past 12 years, Ákadóttir has released 12 records, including as a member of Pascal Pinon and Samaris, collaborated with renowned artists Ólafur Arnalds and Damien Rice, scored the award-winning Icelandic film Backyard Village, and garnered fansacross the world – including Björk, who cites Ákadóttir as an inspiration.https://jfdrcurrent.com/N﻿icklas PashburgComposer and contemporary pianist Niklas Paschburg was born in Hamburg . Following his first EP “Tuur mang Welten”, he released his debut album in 2018. ‘Oceanic’ was a moving trip full of both melancholy and energy; twelve instrumental songs between neo-classical, ambient and electronic music, inspired by nature. This period was a defining experience for the young German composer, grown up as a pianist: “As a teenager I used to listen to Nils Frahm, Ólafur Arnalds, Hauschka and all that world, and my EP was influenced by those artists. Paschburg's music articulates the traces remote environments have left in Niklas’ mind – something pressing is present in the music, its urgency roams searching for sources of energy and relief. All these impressions come from a piece of music which is both melancholic and positive, something to cradle us from anxieties, to make us both dance and run.https://niklaspaschburg.com/-﻿-D﻿oors : 20.00T﻿ickets : €22.50 - €27.50  + FeesH﻿B x","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Performances', 'Dublin Music Performances', '#homebeat', '#sugarclub', '#jfdr', '#nicklaspashburg']",From €24.71

Currently studying at BIMM in Dublin, Smith is already attracting plenty of attention for his clever, catchy, quirky and original songs and his equally quirky look.

In 2021, Smith teamed up with producer Dave Ayers (Studio 51) to record his debut album, titled Storyboard. It features 12 original tracks that showcase Smith’s incredible voice and invites the listener to peek inside his Alice in Wonderland mind where all sorts of magic and mayhem are sonically produced.

Smith’s musical theatre background serves him well both vocally and performance wise and although strongly influenced by artists such as Billy Joel and Jeff Lynn, his style is comparable to the genius of Jonathan Richmond and MIKA. Smith doesn’t have a self-conscious bone in his body and cares little about whether something is cool or not. He’s just happy to sing and that’s massively to his credit. His ability to take his audience down the rabbit hole on a magnificent sing-along joy ride is worth the money alone.

He releases his first single titled “Shotgun” on all streaming and download, platforms on April 7th. The official launch takes place in The Grand Social Dublin on April 18th when AaRoN Smith, accompanied by a full band, will play a number of tracks from his forthcoming album.

A young 21 year old man murdered in an RIRA bomb with 28 others. His uncle murdered by the IRA. Now the British government has decided to reward the murderers with amnesties and betray and punish these victims along with thousands of others with a Bill of deceit and lies to appease the murderers and whitewash the truth. This film has been shown and supported in the Irish, British and EU Parliament buildings. Join us on the 18th April and watch the truth unfolding. We the victims ask the public to join those in the EU, British and Irish Parliaments in supporting us by rejecting the biggest abuse of human rights in the history of the United Kingdom and Ireland by the British government. Stand with us, the innocent victims and their families. The way forward for victims and survivors must be determined by victims and their families not the politicians, academics or civil servants. Twenty Five years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, victims show how they have been forgotten and betrayed by the justice system and the British government. ""The VICTIMS STORIES""  is victims led and victims centred. Join us and support us.

His aim of transforming conflict and promoting social justice in Northern Ireland and across the world is shared by the Mitchell Institute. We are honoured to partner with the Embassy of Finland, London, to host the Harri Holkeri Lecture Series.About the LectureAt a time of profound change in the international political landscape, this lecture examines three of the constants that underpin diplomacy in almost all circumstances: perspective, compromise, integrity. Anne Anderson draws on her own extensive experience in diplomacy to provide some illustrations, as well as addressing some of today’s most pressing issues, including the conflict in Ukraine and the West’s increasingly complex relationship with China. She also applies the same prism in looking at the post- Brexit situation in Northern Ireland and the way ahead for the island as a whole.About the SpeakerDr Anne Anderson had a forty-five year career in Ireland’s diplomatic service, entering the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1972 and retiring in 2017. For the last twenty two years of her career, she served successively in five Ambassadorial posts: Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Geneva (1995-2001), Permanent Representative to the European Union (2001-2005), Ambassador to France (2005-2009), Permanent Representative to the United Nations, New York (2009-2013) and Ambassador to the United States (2013-2017). She was the first female Irish Ambassador in each of those posts. Following her retirement, she became a member of the UN Secretary General’s Advisory Group on the Peace Building Fund (2018-2022), serving as Chair of the Group for the latter two years. Her current roles include Non-Executive Director of the Smurfit Kappa Group, Chair of the Advisory Group of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy in Washington DC, and a Board member of Druid Theatre, Galway.

But does it need to be this way and are there positive things we can do, that will make it easier for us all to feel accepted and welcome in the church family going forward?The Third Order Society of St Francis, (TSSF) an Anglican Tertiary Order, is pleased to organise its annual symposium, with support from Changing Attitude Ireland, (CAI) on Saturday 15th April from 10.00am to 3.30pm, to give voice to deep concerns we all share at the exclusion of LGBTQ+ people from church life & leadership in Northern Ireland and Ireland. As part of our joint commitment to social justice and inclusivity, TSSF and CAI have invited four guest speakers to join us at First Church Hall, Rosemary Street, Belfast, to discuss their diverse experiences, their beliefs and their hopes for the future inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in the church at large.  Speakers include:Canon Ginnie Kennerley is a former journalist and university lecturer and she came to Ireland with her husband from London  After working for the Irish Times and the Sunday Press up to 1984, she graduated from TCD in Theology and Biblical Studies and was one of the first women ordained deacon and then priest in 1990, when this became possible in the Church of Ireland in 1990. She was recruited to Changing Attitude Ireland around 2010 after preaching in Christ Church Cathedral against the Anglican Covenant proposals. Dr. Leo Kilroy is an out, gay Irish man who identifies as a Christian. While a member of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland he sat on the Church's Select Committee on Human Sexuality. In 2017 he proposed a motion to the Synod on church blessings for gay couples. He served as secretary of Changing Attitude Ireland for a number of years. David Austin is a vicar in Oldham, the CJP officer for Mersey Valley TSSF and the Chair of Oldham LGBTQI Pride Festival. He became a Christian at the age of 14 and immediately felt called to full time church ministry. He has always felt drawn to work with the marginalized - based upon his own experiences as a Gay man. Mrs Lesley Macaulay lives in Portstewart with her husband Tony. They were both active members within the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, until 2018 when they resigned as members of the Church, when it ruled that anyone in a same-sex relationship could not be a full member of the Church. Lesley’s daughter Beth was in a same sex relationship. Lesley has continued to support the LGBT+ community and parents of LGBT+ children. In addition to presentations from the four guest speakers, there will be time for discussion of the topics covered by speakers, in groups, plus opportunity to hear briefly about the work of TSSF and CAI and to have a light lunch.The TSSF and CAI intend this day to be a one that offers encouragement, affirmation, and support, especially for people who have experienced hurt, rejection or discrimination in the church because of their sexuality.Places are limited to just 60, and selling fast, so we encourage you to book your place in advance to avoid disappointment.  As a light lunch and refreshments will be served at the event, we are making a small charge of £10pp, or £5pp if a student or unwaged.Please contact Jo Pawson - Joanna_pawson@yahoo.co.uk - if you have any questions.","['United Kingdom Events', 'Belfast Events', 'Things to do in Belfast', 'Belfast Conferences', 'Belfast Spirituality Conferences', '#lgbtq', '#church']",From £6.13

Professor Aisling McMahon will introduce the project which examines the bioethical implications posed by patents – and how they are used -over technologies related to the human body (e.g. isolated human genes, medicines, and elements of medical devices), including how such patents can impact how we treat, use and modify our human bodies. Following this, Professor Susi Geiger (UCD) and Dr Christine Kelly (UCD) will provide reflections on such issues based on insights from their respective fields. This will be followed by a keynote lecture delivered by Professor Jorge Contreras on “The Civil Rights Case Against Gene Patents in America”. Professor Contreras is the James T. Jensen Endowed Professor for Transactional Law and Director of the Program on Intellectual Property and Technology Law at the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine. He is the author of the 2021 book, The Genome Defence: Inside the Epic Legal Battle to Determine who owns your DNA (NY:Hachette/Algonquin, 2021).K﻿ey Note Lecture:  The Civil Rights Case Against Gene Patents in America In 2013, the US Supreme Court held that naturally occurring genetic sequences may not be patented, instantly invalidating thousands of existing patent claims and opening the market for genetic screens for cancer and other hereditary diseases.  The case, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, was remarkable in many ways, not least because it was litigated as a civil rights case rather than a technical patent case. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation, who brought the case in 2009, represented a group of twenty plaintiffs -- researchers, professional associations, medical practitioners and individual patients – in arguing that human genes, even when isolated from the human body and purified in the laboratory, constituted “products of nature” that are ineligible for patent protection. Yet the case hinged not only on this technical legal argument, but on a host of underlying policy considerations ranging from access to healthcare to self-knowledge and freedom of thought. As the case progressed through the courts, it attracted significant attention not only from the biotech industry and the patent bar, but from patient groups, women’s rights activists and the highest levels of the Obama Administration.  In The Genome Defense: Inside the Epic Legal Battle to Determine Who Owns Your DNA (Hachette/Algonquin, 2021), Professor Jorge Contreras brings this important and unique case to life.  Through nearly 100 interviews with attorneys, advocates, judges, patients and government officials, Contreras peels back the layers of this remarkable episode in American legal history and explains not only what happened, but why and how, and what its implications are for the future of medical research, the biotech industry and our personal relationship with our genetic makeup.Biography of Key Note Speaker: Professor Jorge L. Contreras:Jorge Contreras is the James T. Jensen Endowed Professor for Transactional Law and Director of the Program on Intellectual Property and Technology Law at the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine. During 2023 he is serving as a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Professor Contreras’s research focuses on intellectual property, antitrust law and science policy. He is the editor or author of twelve books and more than 150 scholarly articles and book chapters.  During his career he has served on the US National Institutes of Health Council of Councils, the Advisory Council of the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) and the National Advisory Council for Human Genome Research (NACHGR), and as Co-Chair of the National Conference of Lawyers and Scientists. He was one of the co-founders of the Open COVID Pledge, a framework for contributing intellectual property to the COVID-19 response and sits on the World Health Organization’s Advisory Council for the Covid Technology Access Pool (C-TAP).

We will have a range of talks offering insights, reflections, guidance and experience on this important topic. Some speakers will offer practical perspectives and experiences on issues related to groundwater and planning – covering case and site studies, as well as insights into complexities of groundwater behaviour in particular environments; others will offer insights from a legal and regulatory perspective that will be invaluable to practitioners; and we will be looking at the topic from an all island perspective. The early career hydrogeologists will present posters and our keynote speakers will cover larger groundwater issues and topics. This will be our first in person meeting since 2019 and we are really looking forward to meeting old colleagues and new colleagues in Tullamore.

It provides a solid foundation to start foraging.,"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 10:30 - 11:30 IST",Sonairte - the National Ecology Centre The Ninch A92 D9XH Laytown,"Foraging for food is our heritage and is one of the best ways we can engage with nature. But why forage now? Research shows that wild plants are far higher in nutrients than commercially grown plants and are far better for our micro-biome, so our immune systems benefit too. Beyond this, foraging is a truly enjoyable way to spend time in nature.This is a short workshop, around 45 mins, and is designed for beginner foragers. It provides a solid foundation to start foraging and will show participants where to forage, what they might find, what to bring, and how to safely identify, harvest and eat the plants.We will walk around the beautiful grounds of Sonairte in Laytown, Co. Meath, identifying Springs’s wild, edible plants and talking about their histories in our food and medicine culture. I will also be providing samples of foraged foods for participants to try.If you’ve thought about experimenting with wild foods, but you don’t know how to start, this workshop is definitely for you.Jenny is a forager, wildcrafter, apprentice herbalist, and author of The Beginner Forager’s Calendar. Having grown up on a farm in Co Louth she has a lifelong love of nature but only began to develop knowledge of wild plants while living in Palestine, where traditional practices of gathering and eating seasonal wild plants and working with them for medicine are still strong. This living tradition deeply inspired a return to plants in Ireland and a commitment to sharing that knowledge with others and especially with people who are just starting out on their foraging journeys.***Sonairte reserves the right to cancel the event if minimum attendance is not met or changes in health regulations relating to COVID-19.Tickets can be purchased at the Sonairte Eco Shop or at the Eventbrite link below.The ticket price is 15 euros ( one child (5+yrs) allowed free of charge)Please include your phone number and email address while booking the ticket so that we may contact you if the course schedule changes or is updatedRefunds will be issued in the event of cancellation minus a small Eventbrite fee.For any further information, please get in touch with us at hello@sonairte.ie",[],€0 – €17.07

Are the classes suitable for women?
Absolutely! In fact, IKMF Krav Maga has a dedicated curriculum just for women which supplements the main curriculum, and all 3 of the instructors in the club are certified to teach this (the program is called ""Stay Away"")



Do I need to know martial arts?

No - you don't need any experience in martial arts. IKMF Krav Maga is quite different to martial arts classes. If you do have experience - you'll find that you'll be able to call on some of your past experience and work it into Krav Maga



Do I need to be fit?

No - our classes are designed to challenge your existing fitness level. You'll find that the class will be a challenge regardless of your level of fitness



What do I wear to class?

When starting out simply wear practical ""workout clothes"" - a t-shirt and tracksuit with runners



What do I bring to my first class?

Bring a bottle of water and a small towel along with wearing the attire described above



What's a typical class like?

Krav Maga focuses on self defence first and foremost. Every class typically involves: a vigorous warm-up to prepare for training, games and drills to prepare you for what's in the lesson, working on specific techniques with partners, then finishing drills to practice what you learned in the class



Do I need any special equipment

Not to get started - but over time we recommend at least a good gum shield for safety. We've lots of information on this so can discuss this with you in person



How much does regular, weekly training cost?

We operate a prepaid model. 4 classes cost €50, each time you attend a class we deduct one. We prompt you to buy more classes when you're almost out of classes. This was introduced to deal with any ""snap closures"" due to Covid and works great for people who work shifts



Do you hold women only classes?

Not at this time - all classes are mixed and suitable for men and women. In practical terms, it benefits everyone to train with people of different sizes and strengths. Mixed classes are more effective in this regard



Are there belts or levels?

Yes - but this isn't mandatory. You're free to continue training with us without taking level tests. For those that do want to take tests we usually hold 1-2 gradings per year and these are a great challenge. Ranks from lowest to highest are Practitioner 1-5, Graduate 1-5 and Expert 1-5","['Ireland Events', 'Kildare Events', 'Things to do in Maynooth', 'Maynooth Classes', 'Maynooth Sports & Fitness Classes', '#fitness', '#protection', '#defence', '#health_and_wellness']",€12.50

The discipline is structured on progressive learning, levels and exams that assess the quality of those who practice it. The style's peculiar fighting technique (Chuan Zhang) strengthens the joints, bringing health benefits, up to the point that it is also used as an effective method of physical rehabilitation. Every movement is directly related to the ancient Oriental philosophy of the eight trigrams the I-Ching, the Book of Changes.

It has been encouraging to see the common sense approach to the adoption of the code at grass roots level, which has resulted in protection for young people and leaders.If young people are to stay involved in sport throughout their adult life, they need to be equipped with the fundamentals to remain involved with sport and physical activity. Equally we need to ensure that their early experiences are positive and enjoyable, irrespective of their ability, gender, social class, race, etc.It is encouraging to see adults, both volunteers and professionals, contribute to these positive experiences by acting as role models in all dealings with young people. In particular the work of Children's Officers at club and national level is instrumental in implementing the Code. We need to build on this valuable work to ensure that all young people see sport and physical activity as an important and valuable aspect of their lives that they will sustain throughout their adulthood.ON LINE INFORMATIONThis on line course will take place using Zoom video and audio conferencing service. If you do not have a Zoom account please download the free app from the  internet prior to the course using the following address www.zoom.us .

This should be the first question you are to ask before choosing a sport for your fitness purpose. Kungfu fitness includes body, breath and mind training. It builds up every muscle, bone, joint and tendon of your body, and can even  make your skin and nerve stronger. No other sports, you name it, running, hopping, balls, tennis, badminton, etc., could be comparably systematic or holistic.Point 2:After having made your choice of a fitness sport, you must persist in practicing it. The persistence here means something like one to two hours a day and two to three days a week. You may well find it very difficult to maintain such a time-consuming habit, because one or two whole hours of playing football or tennis, or running aside the riverbank, etc. seems not only too luxury to a full time professional or student, but also exhaustive to your body and mind. Kungfu fitness, however, can easily be persisted in if scheduled properly. For example, you can stretch while reading or typing; improve your strength when on the bus or walking to work; and even do breathing meditation while sleeping.Point 3:Kungfu, in a specific sense, refers to Chinese martial arts or Wushu. It generally means any study, learning, or practice that requires patience, energy, and time to complete. Kungfu’s three functions are: Fighting, Show and Fitness. Three fundamental factors of Kungfu are: Strength, Flexibility and Speed.","['United Kingdom Events', 'Belfast Events', 'Things to do in Belfast', 'Belfast Classes', 'Belfast Sports & Fitness Classes', '#fitness', '#kungfu', '#martial_arts']",Cancelled

This is the stuff that actually works!Movement and Mobility is suited to anyone & everyone - beginners, athletes, coaches, physiotherapists, people with no flexibility, people with too much flexibility, people with no coordination - you will leave with invaluable information!Whether it is enhancing your own personal practice or improving how you work with others, Movement and Mobility is for you.The seminar includes:Learning how to assess where you're currently at (and how to improve quickly)Changing your language to avoid self-labelling with imbalances & dysfunctionsProgressing your mobility towards achievable goalsFun exercises for stability, flexibility, correct muscle activation & core strength Discovering the root cause on long term injuriesBuilding daily habits that will last you a lifetime and always make you strongerExperimenting with your mobility practice, getting curious & having a wiggle!A﻿nd of course, how to become Flong & Sexible 😎We cover range of movement for every part of your body, showing you things to look out for short & long term that will keep you mobile, strong and prevent injuries.We share the essential, foundational things that everyone missed and teach in an easy to understand, practical way!Some common questions:1. I'm not flexible, should I attend?YES! This is the perfect seminar for you, we give standards and goals for you to work towards which actually give you direction from where you are at now and things to look out for along the way.2. I am really flexible, will I actually get anything from the seminar?Totally! We show people how to control the ranges that they have too, a big focus of the entire day is to know how to create and increase tension - giving you more body control and strength to make your overall training way better!3. I am a coach, is this just for beginners?Coaches and physiotherapists, chiropractors and doctors have all attended the seminar and have always taken something away from it. The best thing about the seminar is that people of all abilities and levels are all mixed together and it really helps give perspective on where someone has been and where they want to go. From the attendees own questions we all learn from each other and really begin to fill in the gaps in everyone's training.4. I'm just in to running, I don't want to lift weights, is the seminar still for me?Completely! There is more to running than meets the eye and learning how to look after all of your joints will help you to keep active well into your later years. There are multiple things that everyone needs to check mobility wise in order to be able to run safely, lower intensity exercise still causes injuries, it just takes a little longer and prevention is best. The best injury is the one you never get!5. Is it really physical?There is a lot of moving and testing on the day but nothing too taxing! Function is our primary goal with the seminar so you will feel muscles in ways you have never felt them before.... but you're not going to be doing 500 burpees!6. What if I cannot do any of the movements?Not to worry at all! We give regressions for everything and during breaks and drills we will be walking around giving individual attention to everyone also! You will not be stuck for something to do!!7. I'm currently injured, is there any point in me coming?Yes! You may not be able to take part in all the practical parts, but you will come away with a much better understanding of how your injury happened and compensations to look out for during your recovery! Tom learned all of his best information when being injured because of his shift in focus, you will really benefit from it.8.  What do I need to wear?Just clothes for moving! You will have your shoes off for a small portion of the day so make sure your sock game is on point 😎 Gyms also get very cold, so wear lots of layers - especially your bottoms as you will be sat on the floor for the first section!9. Do you cover The Simplistic Mobility Method® in the seminar?Yes we go into a lot of the movements from SMM and why they are so important. You don't need to have the program to get the benefits from the seminar but it is common for people that have the program already, so you're already up to speed on the principles which always leads to brilliant eureka moments!10. Will Tom take a picture with me?!Of course!

This includes responding to conflict situations. In this session, Deirdre will explore and address concerns of therapists who get caught up in the midst of couples who are parents navigating their relationship which sometimes leads to separation and consequent struggles over the navigation of children’s lives. Deirdre will address the erosion of therapy boundaries and litigation issues,  in particular the challenges facing therapists being dragged into conflicting issues between hostile couples -such as parenting their child/ children, including issues which affect therapy with children .Deirdre Hayes, a qualified systemic psychotherapist and Supervisor – also known as a family therapist for individuals, couples and families. I have spent my working life first as a social worker in different fields of practice – Child Protection, medical, mental health, disability,  later as a family therapist moving into adult and child mental health and child guidance work, including being a clinical manager of a Child Sexual Abuse Assessment and therapy Centre in Ireland. I have a postgraduate qualification in Healthcare Management from Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. I trained as a mediator in the UK.   I obtained specialist further training in working with couples with The Gottman Institute and Sue Johnson Emotionally Focused Therapy.   I lived abroad at times, and have practiced as a psychotherapist and teacher of psychotherapy in the UK, Denmark, Russia, China, Egypt and Singapore, which has offered me much by way of intercultural experience and still continues to do so. My current private practice is largely couple work, with some individual and families also. I supervise therapists and teach systemic psychotherapy.  I am a lecturer and live clinical supervisor in the Systemic Psychotherapy Master’s Degree Programme in the School of Medicine in University College Dublin since 2018.Vicarious Trauma and Compassion Fatigue – The Cost of Caring(20:15 - 21:30) The practitioner’s empathy and ability to witness are key aspects of not just our professional ability but also of our humanity. However, when we are repeatedly exposed to traumatic stories or seemingly intractable problems, our sense of safety in the world can change, our compassion can become eroded and we can begin to feel a range of responses such as feeling helpless, hopeless, de-skilled, exhausted, confused, etc. Left unacknowledged this can result in the development of Vicarious Trauma and Compassion Fatigue and if not addressed we may develop Secondary Traumatic Stress Disorder which mirrors our clients’ PTSD. Course ContentIn this evening interactive presentation comprising both theoretical and practical elements we will:Examine the characteristics of Vicarious Trauma and Compassion Fatigue;Identify any characteristics that we may be experiencing;Reflect on how we may be unconsciously defending against Vicarious Trauma or Compassion Fatigue with the people we work with and possibly unknowingly silencing them;Touch briefly on the importance of developing an ethical and self-tailored care plan to help increase our resilience in the face of secondary traumatic injuries such as Compassion Fatigue and Vicarious Trauma in a bid to move towards compassion resilience.Patricia Allen-Garrett, BSc (Hons) Psychology, MSc Counselling & Psychotherapy, Dip Counselling & Psychotherapy (MIAHIP, ECP) works as a humanistic and integrative psychotherapist in private practice and incorporates somatic and parts work into her client-work.

The evening will be opened by a representative of Irish Aid, and moderated by Dr David Nyaluke, Vice-Chair of the African Scholars Association and DSAI Business and Development Study Group Convenor.  Abstract:The trajectory of development in sub-Saharan Africa remains puzzling to mainstream economists. Poverty stays stubbornly high, growth has been uneven, and life expectancy has continued to lag relative to other regions, despite governments adopting policies inspired by neoclassical economics. Economists have used a host of extraneous explanations for what some have called “Africa’s tragedy,” including ethnicity, geography, colonial history, the legacy of the slave trade, poor governance, poorly developed social capital, and other things.This talk provides a critical review of the mainstream understanding of inequality in Africa and illustrates how policies arising from standard economics have exacerbated conditions.   It will argue that the effort to understand income inequality needs to transcend neoclassical economics to focus on the evolution of the institutions, related economic structures, and the way Africa has been integrated into the global economy, all of which determine current and historical patterns.. It will discuss the institutional approach to income distribution and explore the patterns we have observed in sub-Saharan Africa through this lens.About the Contributors:Keynote Speaker - Howard Stein is a Professor in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the Dept. of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan. He is a development economist educated in Canada, the US and the UK. He has also published more than a dozen books and edited collections and more than 100 journal articles, book chapters and reviews. He has held various academic appointments at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania: Hitotsubashi University, Japan, Sussex University; UK, University of Lisbon, Portugal; and University of Leiden, Netherlands. He has undertaken research in a variety of African countries on foreign aid, finance and banking, neoliberalism, the methodology of Randomized Controlled Trials, health and gender, climate change, industrial policy, export processing zones, agricultural policy, African overpayment on sovereign bond issues, poverty and rural property right transformation, income inequality, Chinese economic relations and the institutionalization of neoclassical economics.Moderator - Dr David Nyaluke is Vice-Chairperson of the African Scholars Association Ireland, UCD Proudly Made in Africa Fellow in Business and Development and Convenor of DSAI Business and Development Study Group. He researches and teaches on 'Doing Business in and with Africa' and on sustainable development across 15 business schools and departments of business in universities, colleges and institutes of technology in Ireland. David's current research is within the area of Africa and the international trade system. His research questions focus on how can the international trade system be reformed in various sectors to foster sustainable development in Africa and globally. Before joining UCD College of Business and Proudly Made in Africa, David completed a PhD from Dublin City University (DCU). His doctoral thesis investigated trajectories of political and economic development transformation of African states from independence into the 21st Century.

 Featuring
 Barry Murphy
 with Thunderclap Murphy, Caoimhe Lavelle, Ben Verth & MC John Moynes
Barry Murphy has been performing comedy since 1988 and is one of the founders of the Comedy Cellar. He has played to crowds all around the world and is one of the stars of Aprés Match and Irish Pictorial Weekly.
Thunderclap Murphy is a songwriter and performer based in Dublin, Ireland. He is a multi-instrumentalist who performs live funk and hip-hop with a loop pedal. In 2019 he played on the Poetry stage at Glastonbury as well as on the Other Voices festival trail in Dingle. In the past, he has been orchestral arranger for projects such as the Global Funk Orchestra, The Bamboo Sessions and a Fela Kuti covers band. His live covers set consists of many 90s hip hop classic and 70s funk tunes. Everything from John Martyn to Dr Dre gets a look in.
Caoimhe Lavelle is an actress, writer, DJ, podcaster and poet and is one the highlights of the spoken word scene. Not least of all because not only does she perform brilliantly witty poetry, she does it while hula hooping!
Ben Verth is a stand-up comedian from Edinburgh, now living it up in Dublin. He regularly gigs all over the UK and Ireland, and he has written and performed for some legendary TV and Radio shows back in his native Scotland (BBC’s The Karen Dunbar Show, Only An Excuse?, Scot Squad and The Good, The Bad and The Unexpected, STV’s The Late Show) and he is co-founder of Edinburgh’s multi-award-winning Monkey Barrel Comedy Club.
John Moynes is a comedian, poet and former schoolboy. As well as writing and performing on stage, radio and television he also often has lunch.

Hamish Hamilton, Hutchinson and Penguin in the UK, Dutton and Harper and Row in the US, Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow independently commissioned new translations of the Russian Classics and British, American and emigrée Russian women assumed roles as literary translators. Some lesser-known female translators were commissioned for their cultural, linguistic, and literary capital and, in return, literary translation provided employment, self-validation, and professional respectability. It also presented a platform for ideological activism including, on occasion, a smokescreen for (political or personal) intrigue. In this talk, I will be drawing on my latest microhistorical research to spotlight the professional careers (the practices, networks, tribulations, and achievements) and the complex socio-political contexts of a selection of forgotten female translators who acted as cultural gatekeepers between Russia, the UK, and US during the Cold War.Cathy McAteer is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter for the ERC-funded project: The Dark Side of Translation: 20th and 21st Century Translation from Russian as a Political Phenomenon in the UK, Ireland and the USA. Her main research interests are in the field of classic Russian literature in English translation, specifically Penguin's Russian Classics. Her first monograph Translating Great Russian Literature: The Penguin Russian Classics (BASEES Routledge series, 2021) is available in Gold Open Access. She is currently finalising her second monograph Cold War Women: Female Translators and Cultural Mediators of Russian and Soviet Literature in the Twentieth Century.","['Ireland Events', 'Dublin City Events', 'Things to do in Dublin', 'Dublin Seminars', 'Dublin Other Seminars', '#literature', '#translation', '#trinitycollegedublin', '#academicresearch']",

This talk will be held in the Irish Studies room, QUB, 27 University Square, at 6pm on 27th April.During the Great War period, Irish Constitutional Nationalists supported Home Rule, which was the demand that the governance of Ireland be returned from Westminster to a domestic parliament in Ireland. The Home Rule bill became law on 18th September 1914, but was inoperative for the duration of the war.  During that same period, African Americans were struggling to exercise social, economic and political rights in an American society that had sharply curtailed those rights since the end of its post-Civil War Reconstruction period. This talk examines three parallels between Irish Constitutional Nationalists and African Americans during the Great War period.*****Tickets from this page are for ON SITE ONLY at QUB*****Photo : Private Henry L.

However, there still remains many challenges for the industry.

We want to see at least a third of land and sea given to nature by 2030.”Craig was previously CEO of Friends of the Earth, where he refocussed the organisation on its unique role of empowering communities to take action where they live, and use that momentum to tackle the climate and ecological crisis. He recently became a trustee of the independent think-tank and charity Green Alliance, and is a member of the Advisory Group for the new coalition Unchecked.UK which is making the cause for the common-sense protections that improve people's lives.
